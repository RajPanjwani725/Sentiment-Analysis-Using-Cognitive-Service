1,The Dark Knight,2008,PG-13,2h 32min,Action; Crime; Drama; ,18 July 2008 (USA),9,2224522,6836,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/WAHXGKleT3QvhqHUlFGIRgcQAjU=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p173378_p_v8_au.jpg,9,Amazing non-stop action and eye-popping skyscraper scenes!,2008-07-24,I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However  my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed  I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home  so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot  it's probably because of my bias. However  for me to give an action film a 9 is very  very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.As far as action goes  it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus  I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds  the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many  this will make the film a must-see  though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself  maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine  but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains  the Joker was great and very  very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly  perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.Overall  this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still  with such amazing eye-candy  who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER  it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.As of today (7/26/08)  this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed  this film is better than THE GODFATHER  CASABLANCA  GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very  very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip.,positive
2,The Dark Knight,2008,PG-13,2h 32min,Action; Crime; Drama; ,18 July 2008 (USA),9,2224522,6836,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/WAHXGKleT3QvhqHUlFGIRgcQAjU=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p173378_p_v8_au.jpg,8,Very well made  moody and gripping with a brilliant Heath Ledger  if a tad bloated,2010-04-03,I grew up on the animated series  loved the first two Batman films  sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins  but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances  but personally I would put Casablanca  Wizard of Oz  Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.The film does suffer from being a little too talky  and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good  and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically  the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut  and ensures that the action is explosive.The plot is a little bloated  with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante  and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes  and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured  and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer  who also composed music for The Lion King  Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies  is outstanding. Rousing  beautiful  haunting  it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal  particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.And I have to mention the acting  as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark  brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint  he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything  just...odd. Anyway  Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed  and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role  as does the excellent Gary Oldman  and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant  he was phenomenal  unpredictable  insane  extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker  but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.Overall  not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox,negative
3,The Dark Knight,2008,PG-13,2h 32min,Action; Crime; Drama; ,18 July 2008 (USA),9,2224522,6836,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/WAHXGKleT3QvhqHUlFGIRgcQAjU=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p173378_p_v8_au.jpg,8,Dark  bleak  and uncompromising,2016-06-03,Following on from BATMAN BEGINS comes Christopher Nolan's second entry in the revitalised Batman film series. I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie and looked forward to this one  aware that many principal cast members were returning. Add to this all the fuss surrounding Heath Ledger's untimely demise and his supposedly terrifying performance as the Joker  and I walked into the cinema ready for a great time. I wasn't disappointed.This is Hollywood blockbuster film-making at its finest: intelligent  well-scripted  with great effects  acting and choreography. This is a powerful  brooding film  even darker than its predecessor  that packs a whole lotta violence into a 12a certificate movie. Okay  so this film ain't gory  but it's certainly one of the most violent and disturbing flicks I've seen in a while. A lot of that is down to Ledger's performance  which has rightly been called brilliant. Blowing memories of Jack Nicholson out of the water  Ledger is a virtuoso in the role  a real freak of nature  a repulsive killer stealing every scene. It's the best performance this actor ever gave  and it's a shame he died when he was just realising his true potential as an actor and not as a wooden pretty boy.The film kicks off with action and follows it with more action. Car chases  fantastic technology (the sonar stuff breaks new boundaries)  some martial arts fights and the biggest and best explosion seen on film...they're all here and they never let up. The bone-breaking blows that Batman rains down on the villains are incredibly powerful and I still can't work out how this achieved a kiddie-friendly rating. The script has plenty of twists and turns  including the deaths of some notable leading characters  and plenty of characterisation as well. Themes of good and evil and what it means to be a hero are explored well and the actors all do their roles justice. Special mention goes to Aaron Eckhart  an actor who I've previously found bland but who's excellent as DA Harvey Dent here.If I had any complaints  it would be that Bale hardly gets a look in as Batman takes a back seat to the villains on display. But when they're so good  who cares? Old-timers Caine and Freeman add sparkle  humour and warmth to their parts and there are lots of laughs along the way to go with the shocks and chills. I found Gyllenhaal to be a lacklustre replacement for Katie Holmes  but she's barely around so that doesn't matter. Special effects are top-notch  with one make-up/CGI job surpassing Arnie's ruined face in TERMINATOR 3. So THE DARK KNIGHT is a fantastic film – dark  bleak and uncompromising. It may be a little too much for some viewers  but I loved every second of it – and I look forward to watching it again. A great film.,negative
4,The Dark Knight,2008,PG-13,2h 32min,Action; Crime; Drama; ,18 July 2008 (USA),9,2224522,6836,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/WAHXGKleT3QvhqHUlFGIRgcQAjU=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p173378_p_v8_au.jpg,0,Great Film,2008-12-23,"Dark Knight  The (2008) **** (out of 4) I'll be honest and admit that I'm not much of a fan of the so called ""comic book"" movies out there. I'll also be honest and admit that I didn't care for the previous series of Batman movies from Burton and Schumacher. Batman Begins on the other hand was a different story as it found it to be incredibly good but a rare occasion as occurred as this sequel is even better. I've always felt that comic book movies didn't contain enough elements of a dark nature nor did they contain very much adult-themed stuff but that's certainly not the case here as this movie contains enough character development and moral questions for three movies. The epic nature of this movie makes it a one of a kind even though I think the 151-minute running time is the only fault in the film. It's rather amazing at how dark this movie is yet movie crowds ate it up but perhaps they ate so much of it up simply because of how dark it is. This film works on so many levels but I think the biggest are its screenplay and actors. The darkness of the story is perfectly brought to the screen by Nolan with his masterful direction  which paints the perfect picture of corruption  greed and moral responsibility. All of the characters from The Joker to Harvey Dent to even Batman must face various moral issues and this type of stuff not only makes for great drama but it brings a lot of depth to this ""comic book"" movie. The performances are all quite remarkable and that includes the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Before seeing the film I kept asking myself if his performance could top that of Jack Nicholson but I think that question shouldn't even be asked as both performances are so completely different that you can't compare them. Ledger certainly steals the show and leaves the viewer with goose bumps each time he's on the screen. It really seems as if he just floats through each scene as if he were a ghost roaming around. The walk that Ledger brings to the character is so refreshing and original that I couldn't take my eyes off of him. That wonderful talk and the brilliant line giving just adds to the fun and was it ever great to see such a dark villain. Christian Bale is also once again very good in the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Again  the screenplay benefits Bale greatly by having him just as dark as the villains. Aaron Eckhart is getting overshadowed by Ledger but he too really deserves a lot of credit as he probably gives the best performance of anyone dealing with the moral issues. His stint as Dent is perfect for a hero and his turn as Two-Face is perfect for a villain. Maggie Gyllenhaal also does a good job in the love interests role as does Michael Caine  Eric Roberts and Morgan Freeman. Gary Oldman also shines in his role of Gordon. What makes the special effects so great is that the movie isn't in their hand as far as entertainment goes. Yes  the effects and chase sequences look great but they work even better because the screenplay gives us characters to care about. I won't go as far as to call this one of the greatest films ever made but I do think it has to change the way comic book movies are made.",positive

However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end  this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him  but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.,positive

The cameras  the sounds  the really cool characters. For me  it's one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once. And  of course  Heath Ledger is as awesome as everyone says. The characterization is so much deeper than the other films. We get to see multidimensional people with purpose  even if the purpose to to kill and maim. We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride. A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself. Also  people do some pretty stupid things  considering what a threat this guy is. These are little things and without them we wouldn't have the huge finale.,positive

Director Christopher Nolan went into a brooding nihilistic territory with The Dark Knight.It introduces The Joker (Heath Ledger) a psychopath laced with cynicism and determined to create chaos. It starts off with a punchy bank heist which The Joker uses to creatively eliminate his cohorts.In Gotham City  Batman (Christian Bale) is happy to see the new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to take on the villains. Dent is also seeing a lot of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)However The Joker creates an alliance with the ring leaders of organised crime in the city and then takes the fight to Batman. Meanwhile Dent realises the extent of corruption in the local police with James Gordon (Gary Oldman) the only honest cop about.Nolan a fan of James Bond films has created several terrific action scenes. One set in Hong Kong is a more over the top homage to a Sean Connery circa Bond film.Nolan also deftly introduces a second villain in the form of Two Face. Much better here than Tommy Lee Jones unconvincingly camping it up with weak material In Batman Forever.Ultimately Nolan puts humanity to test here as The Joker places two bombs in two ships. One full of civilians and another full of prisoners being evacuated. The Joker wants destruction and turmoil. He simply wants to watch the world burn.The Dark Knight is also bloated and at times cumbersome with its long running time.,positive

However  chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity  and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster  with a solid and deep story  great direction  performances  special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic  with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics  morality  human nature  hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker  and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag  from ""Prison Break""  and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end  ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie  the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008  but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated  ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")",negative
9,The Dark Knight,2008,PG-13,2h 32min,Action; Crime; Drama; ,18 July 2008 (USA),9,2224522,6836,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/WAHXGKleT3QvhqHUlFGIRgcQAjU=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p173378_p_v8_au.jpg,0,"Impressive blockbuster with dark tone  plot  characters and delivery making its satisfyingly ""grown-up""",2008-09-11,"Batman has proved successful in cleaning up the streets and a fresh new DA  Harvey Dent  is keen to clean up the mobsters in one big conspiracy case. Naturally an unpopular move  particularly with the psychotic villain known as ""The Joker""  who makes it his mission to unveil the identity of the Batman  before killing him. The Joker begins his reign of terror  forcing the citizens of Gotham to wonder whether or not it was worth having a Batman if this is the sort of chaos that his presence unleashes. With the stakes raised higher than ever  Bruce Wayne struggles to hold onto his moral code in the face of villain whose only aim is to unleash chaos and panic across the city.I waited a few weeks for all the hype to die down  but I was looking forward to seeing this film because Batman Begins had done a great job of repairing a character and franchise that was in tatters as Schumacher's gaudy and unlikeable Happy Meal-selling film had finished with it. I was hoping for more of the same as The Dark Knight did not disappoint as the tone continues to be dark and as realistic as a film can be when it is about a man dressed as a bat. The film is a summer blockbuster but yet it manages to at least get close to a really engaging and interesting plot  this is a joyful far cry from The Fantastic Four and the like  this feels like a film that is marketed to me  not my children. As such the plot does offer some good moralising and conflicts that are what I expected from the damaged ""hero"" of Batman and the freaks he is up against. Again  it is not a ""proper"" drama but these elements are effective within the bigger picture and they only help draw the viewer into the story and characters.The fact that it does engage also means that the action is much more effective. I watched Wanted the other night where everything was so simplistic and dumb that I never cared and the action was only effects. Here the tone is deadly serious and the action feels urgent and dangerous. This has produced the problem in the UK over the rating and I do think that it should have been a 15  although I can understand why it got a 12A. Problem for the certification body is that the film doesn't contain much in the way of graphic acts but it is the tone that is so very harsh and dark  thus making it feel much more violent than it actually is. For me this is not a problem as the film is not for children and I am not a child  but I can sort of see why The Daily Mail jumped on it as the destruction of the mankind or whatever they said it was going to do to our children. I do like the dark tone though and it is not just a visual thing or something in a specific few scenes but rather woven through the whole film. It starts with the characters and performances and of course comes across in the direction and cinematography  which is suitably dark and Gothic without being camp or unrealistic.The cast do good work but all are in the shadow of Ledger  not because it is fashionable to praise him but because his is a great turn and makes the film. I do feel sorry for Jack Nicholson because his Joker now looks like a childishly simple creation that is a bit of cheesy fun but no more. With Ledger we genuinely feel unnerved with him on the screen  his clothes and make-up being all part of this unhinged creation with his ticks and hair-trigger air; his performance is part of the film working as well as it does as he sells the character and the material. If he does get an Oscar nod  it will not (just) be for sympathy  but because he genuinely is that good. Bale finds himself a supporting player in his own film but deals with it well; not sure about his laughably gruff voice as Batman though  it just distracts. Eckhart is a good bit of casting because he normally plays morally dubious characters  so the contrast works at the start and he can work with the later stages. Gyllenhaal has her critics but she is much better than Holmes and stands up well with the all-male cast. The supporting cast offer the usual quality in Oldman  Caine and Freeman as well as other faces in minor roles such as Roberts  a returning Murphy  Carbonell  McFarlane  White  Fichtner  Lister and others.The Dark Knight is a great film. The dark tone  good plotting  strong characters  performances and overall design and delivery all make for a grown-up blockbuster that is heads and shoulders above its peers. Ledger is impressive and drives the film forward in an adult and engaging way. Parents with the legal ability to take their four year olds should think twice  because this is not a kiddie blockbuster  but for everyone else there is a great deal to enjoy here.",positive

I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it  even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre  this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called ""The Joker""  but even with Heath Ledgers great performance  this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough  even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie  but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger  but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books  I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!",positive

This was the severely grim and gritty version of the Batman  ushered in by Frank Miller's initial treatment in the landmark graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"" in 1986. Miller's portrayal of the iconic super hero took the gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes. The movie explores this theme at many levels  and would have served up enough of a plot to keep this viewer interested even without the explosions  chases and general mayhem that modern day audiences need to get their fix on. Actually  the Joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down from one of Batman's cables over the streets of Gotham  as noted in my summary line above. In the comic book world  they HAVE been fighting each other forever  or as long as forever exists since the creation of Batman back in 1939; the Joker came on the scene in 1940 in the comic  Batman #1.I don't think this could have been the same picture without Heath Ledger in the role of Batman's all time greatest nemesis. His portrayal blows away Jack Nicholson's performance in 1989's ""Batman""  and that's through no fault of Nicholson's. Today's films are a product of harsher and deadlier times  and it's striking that Ledger's characterization would define the Joker as an extremist  perhaps even a terrorist. More than once I found myself questioning what was going on during the opening bank robbery scene. The bad guys were offing each other based on instructions delivered by the Joker  and you suddenly come to the realization that this domino game had to end with one man standing. It's how we're introduced to Ledger's definitive Joker  a performance that won't be topped.Another thought came to me as I watched the story unfold  and that was how similar the coin toss gimmick paralleled the one in ""No Country For Old Men"". Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) began using the tactic following the death of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal)  and I began picturing Javier Bardem in the role of The Joker. Hard to imagine who might have been the more evil character  Bardem's Anton Chigurh in a more realistic setting  or The Joker in a fictional Gotham City. Fortunately  not a choice one would normally have to consider.I'm a little bit on the fence as to Christian Bale's portrayal of The Batman. He's more than adequate as Bruce Wayne  but the voice he gives to the Dark Knight seems a bit melodramatic. Granted  he couldn't use the same voice as his alter ego  but there were times that it sounded so forced as to come across as parody  and other times just goofy  almost a throwback to the Adam West days of the TV Batman. Strange  but have you considered that no one ever calls him the Caped Crusader anymore either?All in all  great performances all around. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the new Commissioner Gordon was excellent  while Michael Caine as Alfred  and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox were solid even with limited screen time. I thought about Katie Holmes just once while making a mental comparison when Maggie Gyllenhaal first appeared on screen. Truthfully  they looked similar enough to effect the transition smoothly to the point where it wasn't distracting for me in the least.Obviously  the set up for the next sequel was firmly set in place with the creation of Two Face  the now alter ego of District Attorney Harvey Dent. The rendering of Dent's burned face was boldly executed and quite marvelous in it's own grotesque way. I'll be looking forward to the next installment.And NOW  for a personal rant. I probably should put this in parentheses because it doesn't have anything to do with the movie  but for this picture to be #1 on the IMDb list of all time best movies after 4 days of release is incomprehensible  if not downright laughable (and I did rate it a 10 myself). I think there should be a moratorium of at least a couple of years before a film qualifies for IMDb ranking  giving the dust some time to settle from all the grand opening hoopla that surrounds a picture like this. I feel the same way about other recent movies like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood""  both of which garnered numerous awards and fan approval. But if they're to be considered among the best films of all time  they'll be considered that way a decade from now without the need for multiple votes from over zealous fan boys.",negative

Here we have the Caped Crusader (Christian Bale) battling The Joker (Heath Ledger in a blood-chilling final performance)  while also trying to navigate the cesspool of crime and corruption that pervades Gotham City.I will say that I found the movie a little silly whenever Batman converses with someone. But what really impressed me was Harvey Dent's (Aaron Eckhart) role. As Gotham's hotshot DA  he represents hope for wiping out all crime; Batman is mostly known as a vigilante. And he can only be known as such  because...well  I'll let you find out what it means.You may have heard that this is a dark movie. Especially The Joker. Whereas Jack Nicholson's Joker was basically a live action Bugs Bunny  Heath Ledger's Joker is a maniacal  ruthless  vicious thug; he seeks only the creation  promotion and dissemination of pure chaos. And there are some REALLY intense scenes throughout the movie; not necessarily violent  but definitely not for the fainthearted.All in all  I wholeheartedly recommend this one. While I could predict some of what was going to happen  much of it surprised me. It will probably surprise you too. Also starring Maggie Gyllenhaal  Michael Caine  Morgan Freeman  Gary Oldman  and small appearances by Cillian Murphy and Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy.",positive

The mafia is growing  and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger  in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals  no goals  no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also  a love triangle forms between Wayne  Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it  fans love it  the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it  too  making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck  even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched  cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting  encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So  there was room for perfection (which is why this film  as great as it is  cannot receive a perfect score).Concerns aside  the film was well done  as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense  the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense  plot twists  unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger  oh my.The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric  declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However  the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker  inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal  but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated  I accept it; and if he wins  that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year  in any genre.As I said in the beginning  my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true  but judging by the sales of the picture  you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't  see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly  depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre.",positive

Basically a criminal terrorist and mastermind calling himself the Joker (posthumous Oscar  BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Heath Ledger) robs the bank run by the mob  and to take on the Mafia district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) becomes the new face for justice and hope in Gotham City  with the help of Batman aka Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and Lieutenant James 'Jim' Gordon (Gary Oldman). Mob bosses Sal Maroni (Eric Roberts)  Gambol (Michael Jai White) and the Chechen (Ritchie Coaster)  who have had Chinese accountant Lau (Chin Han) hide their funds  are confronted by the Joker because he wants to kill the  but they all refuse to help  putting a bounty on him. The Joker kills Gambol  and his gang go under his control  and meanwhile Batman  with new technology supplied by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman)  has found and returned Lau to Gotham to testify in a court case to help bring down the gangsters. The Joker puts his plan into action by threatening the city  if the Dark Knight does not reveal his true identity he will kill people  and soon enough he starts killing the people involved in the mob boss court cases  including Commissioner Loeb (The Fast Show's Colin McFarlane) and Judge Surrillo (Nydia Rodriguez Terracina)  and Dent may be next. Dent is hidden  and Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who has been dating Dent is being looked after by Bruce's faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth (Sir Michael Caine)  but the Joker appears to kill Gordon  who sacrifices himself to save the Mayor (Nestor Carbonell)  and when Bruce plans to reveal his identity to the press Dent claims he is the Batman. This means that the district attorney is taken into protective custody  but the Joker catches up and tries to kill him  but Batman inside his armoured car and then on his motorcycle is on their tail  and Gordon who faked his death catches the criminals  and gets promoted to Commissioner. Batman demands to know from the clown prince of crime where Dent and Rachel are  as they have disappeared  and eventually  after some beating  he reveals that they are both in separate buildings full of explosives  Batman planned to find Rachel  but he instead gets to Dent  so Rachel is blown up and dies  while Dent is taken out  but petrol on half his face ignites when the explosion happens. Using documents  Wayne Enterprises accountant Mike Engel (Anthony Michael Hall) has concluded that Bruce Wayne is Batman  so he plans blackmail  and meanwhile the Joker has escaped prison and kills Lau and the Chechen  and he threatens to bomb a hospital if Reese isn't killed. While the accountant is rescued by Gordon  the Joker visits Dent in hospital  who has become scarred on half his face and donned the persona of Two-Face  he tells him that the mob is responsible for the death of Rachel and convinces him to get revenge  on a coin flip decision. Gotham General Hospital was blown up  while Two-Face manages to find and kill Maroni and two corrupt cops who helped kidnap Rachel  and the Joker has rigged two ships  one carrying civilian passengers and the other Arkham Asylum inmates  with explosives  and both sets of people have the trigger for the opposite ship  with the demand to blow up the other ship before midnight  or both be exploded. With the help of Fox and a computer as a citywide tracking device  they manage to find where the Joker is  in a building  where hostages are wearing clown masks to look like criminals to the SWAT  but they are saved  both ships refuse to blow up each other  and the Joker despite being caught boasts that he has won when Dent's rampage will be revealed. Gordon is lured to the building where Rachel died where his wife and children are being held hostage  and Dent is threatening their lives from the flip of his coin  and after being shot while wearing body armour Batman tackles Dent  causing him to fall from the top of the building to the ground  and saving Gordon's son. So that Dent will remain a symbol of hope for Gotham City  Batman wants to take responsibility for the deaths of the people Dent murdered  Gordon is upset but is forced to agree  so he orders a manhunt for Batman  while Alfred spares Bruce anymore heartache by burning a letter that Rachel wrote announcing her engagement to Harvey  and Fox sees the tracking computer self-destruct. Also starring Monique Gabriela Curnen as Ramirez  Ron Dean as Wuertz  Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow aka Dr. Jonathan Crane  William Fichtner as Bank Manager and The Fifth Element's Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as Tattooed Prisoner. Bale is still fantastic as the silly playboy and the rough and ready dark hero  Ledger is fascinating as the psychopathic and intelligent scar-faced villain (the licking of lips is a great psycho touch)  Eckhart is alright as the slowly maddened political figure turned Two-Face  and the other cast members are good too. Just with the previous film the story is much more grown up and sophisticated compared to the previous incarnations  the make-up is good  and of course the explosions and special effects used create many more exciting chase and fight sequences  a cool and entertaining action fantasy. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing  and it was nominated for Best Art Direction  Best Cinematography  Best Editing  Best Makeup  Best Sound and Best Visual Effects  and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography  Best Costume Design  Best Editing  Best Make Up & Hair  Best Music for Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard  Best Production Design  Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects.

When only one is left he removes his mask to reveal a disturbing face; he is wearing predominantly white make up with black around his eyes and a disturbing red smile he is The Joker and clearly he is insane. It turns out the money he stole belonged to the mob and they are worried about losing the rest; either to The Joker or to the forces of law and order. Leading the campaign against crime in Gotham is a new white knight; DA Harvey Dent; a man who intends to take down the criminals by using the system rather than hiding behind a mask. Soon Dent  Lt. Gordon and Batman are after The Joker; and he in turn is after them and those they love.I put off watching this for a long time fearing I'd be disappointed; surely no film could live up to the hype this one received It turned out I needn't have worried; this is a fantastic film. The returning cast members perform well but it is the new characters that really stand out. Heath Ledger certainly deserved his Oscar; his Joker is genuinely disturbing  Aaron Eckhart is great too in the roll of Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhaal shines as his girlfriend  and Bruce Wayne's old friend Rachel. Those wanting action will be pleased as it rarely stops and is spectacular; this doesn't mean there is any sacrifice of good characterisation and plot though. There are some good surprises along the way as well as a degree of tragedy. If you think superhero films are for children you should be aware that there are plenty of disturbing and even brutal moments here which might disturb youngsters I was a little surprised that it got a UK '12' certificate; it is certainly a 'high 12'. Overall I'd say don't worry about the hype just sit back and enjoy an excellent action film that just happens to have a superhero as its main character.,positive

Really I did. And I could appreciate the effort that went into the performances and the wads of dough that must have been spent on special effects. The atmosphere too is lucidly rendered -- night time in the big city.But my enjoyment was hampered by the fact that I'd outgrown most of this stuff about the time I entered High School  and that was when the comic-book Batman still looked like a human being  not a bemuscled behemoth.The experience  the viewing of this  as much of it as I could stand  was exhausting. You have never seen so many vehicles  large and small  racing through the gloomy and deserted urban streets. And every one of them seems to crash and turn into an exploding fireball emitting shards of glass and flaps of unidentifiable metal.The business is taken seriously too. The blows rained upon the victims seem to hurt. The occasional wisecracks from The Joker don't begin to make up for the realistic pain.It all makes me wonder if our peculiar civilization hasn't entered the decadent period that precedes its fall from dominance. At least in the comic books you had to READ the dialog bubbles. Here  no challenge at all. Just sit back and let the despondency overwhelm you.I know  I know. I missed the point. It's just a fantasy.

There are absolutely no dry spots in this fascinating film. Does everything make sense? Of course not; there are a lot of holes in the story  but it's a superhero action film and it's not meant to be dissected for credibility. It's just supposed to entertain  and that it does.A large part of the credit for that goes to Heath Ledger for his ""The Joker"" portrayal. Every scene in which Ledger appeared was riveting. His speech  mannerisms and his dialog were fantastic. For the latter  I have to commend the screen writers who gave Ledger some great lines!Actually  he and Aaron Eckert  who played ""Harvey 'Two Face' Dent "" were most of the show  character-wise. Maggie Gyllenhaal was good  too  as ""Rachel Dawes "" the woman of both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent's affections. Otherwise  the familiar good guys - Christopher Bale as ""Batman "" Michael Caine as ""Alfred "" Gary Oldman as Inspector/Commishoner Gordan"" and Morgan Freeman as ""Lucius Fox"" were okay but all more interesting in the previous film  ""Batman Begins."" Speaking of Fox  his high-and-mighty attitude toward Wayne's surveillance system was disappointing to hear. I had thought he had trust in Bruce Wayne. Also  I was sorry to hear the language deteriorate in the final half hour with some unneeded profanity by some inconsequential character.Overall  however  this latest Batman movie ranks among the best of any I've seen  at least on the first viewing. I'm looking forward to watching it again when the Blu-Ray disc comes out next month. This is a great film to enjoy visually and audibly with some fantastic action scenes and excellent dialog.I had heard that Batman was a ""dark"" and almost unlikable figure  himself  in this film but I did not find that. Hey  he did what he had to do to stop a maniacal killer (which ""Fox"" didn't understand.  nor some of the other main characters.) For a guy who has provided nothing but good deeds for the fickle citizens of Gotham over the years  this hero certainly doesn't appear to be appreciated......except by his fans of comics and film.In fact  that's the only main thing I would dispute with the writers of this movie: their conclusion at the end that Batman is ""not a hero  but a dark knight."" No  I would say someone who continually risks his life to save others is quite a hero!",positive

The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero  well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape  for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane  following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine  Gary Oldman  Cillian Murphy   among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard   and colorful  dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨  ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part.

Why? Well because I am not much fan of superhero movies or comic book heroes who ventured to the big screen. However  having seen all the older Batman movies  I will say that with ""The Dark Knight""  then Christopher Nolan have really put the previous Batman movies to shame.And with good reason.The storyline in ""The Dark Knight"" is for a more mature audience  and it appeals to an audience capable of coherent thought  unlike the pseudo-comical older Batman movies.And with an impressive list of talent on the cast list  then ""The Dark Knight"" really does impress. However  I remember the hype about Heath Ledger's death and his performance of the Joker in this movie. With the risk of offending a great number of people here  then I don't really get that hype. His performance was good  sure  but it was a bit hyped up by the media. Jack Nicholson did a good enough job with his interpretation of the Joker back in the day  but he didn't get this much hype.Moving on  ""The Dark Knight"" offers a good storyline  spiced up with nifty action sequences  and of course a lot of bat utilities - as always.""The Dark Knight"" was a major step upwards from ""Batman Begins""  and I must admit that this movie have sparked an interest in actually sitting down to watch ""The Dark Knight Rises"" as well.",positive

The Dark Knight is undeniably visually impressive  full of flashy special effects  stunning production design and spectacular action set-pieces  but the fans who have rated this film so highly clearly have as little grip on reality as its antagonist The Joker (Heath Ledger).152 minutes of relentlessly dark  dreary  depressing drama—the enjoyment factor turned down to the lowest possible setting—this overly complex and frequently logic-free sequel to Batman Begins sees director Christopher Nolan once again presenting the antics of a man dressed as a bat in a completely humourless fashion. And if Nolan is going to take matters so seriously  then so am I...Could a man with half his face burned off really get out of bed the next day to conduct a vendetta? Why does Batman talk to Fox in his 'gruff' voice when the man already knows his real identity? How do you get hundreds of barrels of explosives onto two ferries without being noticed? Likewise  how did The Joker wire up a hospital to blow-up without being spotted? Who built Batman's underground silo? Does anyone really know what the hell was going on during that scene with that cell phone sonar equipment and the building full of baddies? Where exactly do you hire a butler who can arrange for a skyhook in Hong Kong? These are just a few of the many questions that arise from Nolan's so-called masterpiece.Rabid Batman/Nolan fans might be all too happy to overlook these somewhat awkward posers  but I can't—not when such a blatantly flawed film currently sits at No.8 in the IMDb top 250.5.5 out of 10  but not good enough to be rounded up to a 6.,positive

In director Christopher Nolan's follow-up to his 2005 blockbuster ""Batman Begins""  Gotham is just another Metropolitan city full of embittered residents squirming under the stronghold of Mafiosos  psychopaths  blackmailers  and terrorists--namely the Joker  who opens the film robbing a bank owned by the Mob with his masked cohorts  whom he has no loyalty to. Heath Ledger won a posthumous Supporting Actor Oscar for his twisted portrayal of the Joker--playing the facially-scarred criminal mastermind as if he just escaped from a lunatic asylum--but it isn't a multi-layered  pleasurable performance. Christian Bale returns as billionaire Bruce Wayne (and his alter-ego  a flesh-and-blood Batman)  putting his trust in Gotham's latest hotshot District Attorney who is dating Wayne's childhood sweetheart and going after the Mafia in court  if the Joker doesn't get to them first. Nolan stages an extended  fiery vehicle chase that is absolutely astounding  yet the rest of his film falls a bit short. The performances are variable  the mood is dour and depressing  and the illogical plot tied in endless  headache-inducing knots. Fans of the Superhero genre will no doubt revel in the sleek look of the picture  but the script (penned by director Nolan and his brother Jonathan) is a disappointment  not helped by the smash-and-grab editing which cuts off and mixes up sequences before the drama has even played out. **1/2 from ****",negative

This second installment is better in many ways  but for me doesn't quite have the charm of the first.Christian Bale of course is back as Bruce Wayne and Batman. But his childhood sweetheart and now District Attorney lawyer is Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. She does a fine job but is a definite step down from Katie Holmes.Most of the buzz has been  especially after his untimely death  Heath Ledger as The Joker. This Joker is quite different from the character Jack Nicholson played in the 1989 version  more sinister and more dangerous. He doesn't have any grand plan  he just enjoys wreaking havoc  and his mission here is to kill innocent people and cause destruction until he succeeds in having Batman's identity revealed. Ledger is chillingly good in this role.Aaron Eckhart is introduced as Harvey Dent who  after getting caught up in an explosion  becomes Two-Face. Michael Caine is back as Bruce Wayne's butler and father figure  Alfred Pennyworth  and plays the role just perfectly. As well as Gary Oldman  back as cop James Gordon. And Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox  now head of the Wayne corporation and Bruce's personal scientific consultant.The new crime boss is Eric Roberts as Salvatore Maroni  and he is superb in the role. I have always been a fan of Roberts' and it is good to see him in a feature role as this.Overall a fine movie  both as a drama and as an action movie.,positive

The previews had all the action and excitement  and some cool-looking gadgets  but... despite the whole ""Heath Ledger is dead  this is final great performance"" hype  I didn't want to second guess myself. A Joker with no real ""origin"" story? Ledger playing him with slapped on  sloppy make-up and lots of facial tics? How will this work  and how could it be any better than Nicholson's Joker? Answers? It does work  very well  though it's dependent on the universe that director Christopher Nolan has set in place. Ledger's Joker wouldn't work in Burton's style  as his mix of camp and seriousness was perfect for an actor like Nicholson. But in Nolan's world  he fits in like a f***ing psychotic glove. To get it out of the way for this review  I'll say this: Ledger practically lives up to the hype. His presence is uncouth and strange  and not like one's used to (the slashes through his face are ""jokingly"" referenced that ""my dad did this  ""my wife did this"")  and he's totally ambiguous. But it's also the unpredictable Joker seen yet on screen  and only topped probably in the craziest of the comics. He's an unpredictable force that is the twisted ying to Batman's protect-by-all-means-but-murder yang. It's basically an anarchic punk rocker taken to the lengths of a terrorist.While this should make the Joker boring  there's nothing that Nolan isn't willing to do to make the audience jump or second guess the plot  which makes it extra exciting as he heads on in the last half hour  leading to an incredible double-catharsis of sorts. But if Ledger's performance is being touted for an posthumous Oscar nomination (which I'm still not sure about though will probably happen)  then the amount of attention being paid to Aaron Eckhardt is minuscule in comparison. On his own terms  Eckhart delivers a performance that's even better than Ledger's (or  rather  he has a lot more complexity than ""I'm gonna blow stuff up and go chaotic here""). He puts in everything that's needed for the perfect Harvey Dent  as a man who's the ""white knight""  someone who could be the one to take the place of Batman as the one to look after Gotham. His downfall  however  becomes the great  horrifying tragedy of this Batman. To say Eckhart blows all other interpretations (on film or TV) of Dent is putting it lightly  and the make-up given to his latter reincarnation is some of the best I've ever seen.In the interest of not coming off like a total crazy fan-boy for the Dark Knight  there are some likely criticisms to have. Despite Nolan's vision being epic and grand  and for the most part pulling off such a big story very well  the last section  however exciting and tense and posing moral questions  goes a little long. And  however staying true to the comics (which is great)  the last section starts to pile on the exposition a bit much. But these are mostly mild quibbles. In the scope of delving into the Batman world as honestly (if not realistically) as possible  Nolan succeeds even further than in 'Begins'. The characters of Batman/Wayne  Gordon  Dent  and Rachel Dawson are all put into incredible circumstances throughout the film  and we're pulling for them and care about what happens all the way. It's all the more a credit to the storytelling power since we should know how things will turn out; a certain twist mid-way through had me thinking ""say it isn't so""  and when I knew I was had  I knew Nolan had done his job well.Another question: does Dark Knight live up to the hype? It depends on how you define it and how it pertains to the movie. A lot of the hype has been around Ledger's death  and the new characters  and some of the hype (i.e. box-office predictions) have become ludicrous. Yet  for what Nolan set out to do as filmmaker  delivering drama and action and pathos and a kick-ass-but-truly-conflicted Batman in his *very* dark city of Gotham  he succeeded admirably. It might not be the same amount of pure ""fun"" of Burton's films  but then again it doesn't need to be. It's an excellent  breathtaking experience  and one of the best pics of 08.",positive

Also  when the Joker was threatening Rachel Dawes  it was the only time I was taken out of the picture since I said aloud that he was threatening Jake Gyllenhaal's sister with my friend mentioning her name since we both saw Heath Ledger and Jake in Brokeback Moutain a few years ago. Ledger is fine as the main villain though I stop at saying he's better than Jack Nicholson in the role or deserves an Oscar nomination though it would be fine if he did. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement from Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's former girlfriend though I remember liking Holmes fine too. And Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent  Dawes' new beau  is also fine with his initial role as ""white knight"" district attorney later turning into what would become known as Two-Face. And I loved having Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler having a previous background in the battling jungles of Burma so he can tell his master of his dilemma there. Throw in Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox and you've almost got a perfect movie. Certainly  Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader is even better here than in Batman Begins and he is to me  like many viewers  The absolute Dark Knight here. While the movie may be longish in spots  Christopher Nolan lets it be that way so he can make us really care for the characters. I certainly was very touched by the sacrifices the new Commissoner Gordon  as played by Gary Oldman  had to make throughout the picture especially when he had to deal with Two-Face and his family's peril near the end. So the many who went to see this once and want to do it again  what are you waiting for? P.S. Having not recognized Anthony Micheal Hall previously  I'll have to look for him the next time I watch which may be soon too!",positive

The Daily News rated this movie *****. It is rather a *** as I shall try to explain.The acting is top-notch  especially Heath Ledger as the Joker and Aaron Eckhart  amazingly good as Harvey Dent  D.A.This is one film that is rare since good does not triumph over evil. Dent's transformation is magnificently realized. It just shows us what situations can lead someone so pious to go so wrong.The film is action packed. The special effects are marvelously arranged.As far as the Oscars for this year go  an argument can be made that Ledger's performance should be in the supporting category as well as Eckhart. Gary Oldham as Gordon  should also be in the running for a supporting Oscar as well as Maggie Gyllenhaal  who has really shown a depth of maturity here in a breakout performance.My lone argument with this film is the last-half hour. Once the Gyllenhaal character is killed off  the film does go a bit down-hill. It becomes confusing at this point. Confusion we don't need as we wish to study the change in dimension depicted by Dent. That being said  the picture is one of a rare quality. A thin line is drawn between good and evil here and we wonder where we can go from here as the credits roll.,positive

I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important  as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie  I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did  however  as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First  the story is wildly original (though  also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films  I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second  the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing  totally amazing  special effects. Third  it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in ""Titanic""--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also  seeing the kid from ""Third Rock"" suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth  I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well  I am simply not an action film fan. And  the insane pace  TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also  while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor  I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they'd either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter  too  found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand  Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it's long  complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However  at this point  there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it  so I'll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many.",positive

After seeing it for myself  I thought it was a good film  but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen  Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige  and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No  I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment  I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters  they are written and acted well  but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story  it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing  but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also  the pace is uneven  as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted  the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths  especially the beautifully crafted production values  dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too  while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing  while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good  both Leonardo DiCaprio  with a more hardened persona which has grown even more  and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.Overall  Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times  it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught  but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate  Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything  but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction. I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought.,positive

His films may be sometimes flawed – as in the case of this one – and often overrated  but at least he's a guy working in Hollywood who strives for originality. INCEPTION might well be his most original film yet  a cerebral thriller that requires audiences to use their brains for once  rather than going over the same old ground. It's not quite the masterpiece that some say it is  but it is an engaging  well-made  and exciting movie that pretty much demands repeat viewings.The first two thirds of the movie had me spellbound. The set-up is intense  throwing out wonderful ideas at the audience and not hanging around to see whether they're accepted. It's definitely a film where you have to pay attention to every second  although saying that I had no trouble following what was going on. As our characters enter dream state after dream state  I was drawn into this world with them. Nolan is at the top of his game and even his super-fast-edited action sequences don't disappoint  with riveting gun battles and a fine car chase thrown in  too. Star Leonardo DiCaprio's back story adds an emotional core to the movie that it would have otherwise been missing and I loved being caught up in the various outlandish shenanigans.Which is why the ending is a little bit disappointing – not a lot  but a little bit nonetheless. The whole setup with the snowbound fortress smacks of Bond  and has a seen-it-all before quality the film sidestepped for the most part. It's as if Nolan pushed himself to the edge with the concepts he introduced in his movie  and then stepped back  afraid. We needed more scenes like the bit with the train and the revolving corridor  and less conventional action. There's plenty of scope for truly mind-blowing stuff in the dream worlds he so painstakingly creates – like the awesome early scene with the folding city. But then he just delivers some sub-Bond antics and wastes what could have been a truly superb premise.I also had a slight problem with the ending  which goes on and on  with multiple scenes dragged out in a manner reminiscent of RETURN OF THE KING (although never quite as bad as that). Still  these are minor flaws in an otherwise very well made and entertaining movie. The ensemble cast are great: DiCaprio has matured nicely as a thinking man's hero  and the normally irritating Ellen Page is okay as the character whom the viewer follows into the antics. Michael Caine delivers a nice cameo  and Ken Watanabe reminds us all of what a fine actor he is. There are also good turns for up-and-coming stars like Joseph Gordon-Levitt  Tom Hardy  and Marion Cotillard  and a very nice performance from one of my favourites  Cillian Murphy. So  while it may not be the masterpiece that I was hoping for  INCEPTION is definitely a step in the right direction of intelligent Hollywood filmmaking.,positive

Sure  our eyes and ears are treated to amazing sites and loud noises each and every week and some would say this causes the brain just to lose any type of reality  which might be the reason certain people (cough Lohan  Hilton and countless others) are able to be hot stories while better  more worthwhile events are simply overlooked. If one doesn't want to use their brain then it's best to stay away from this thing. It's best not to know too much about the story but it deals with a troubled man (Leonardo DiCaprio) who has made it a job to break into people's dreams and steal their ideas. However  due to a personal tragedy  he is forced to take a job doing the opposite  which is breaking into a man's dream to plant an idea. That's pretty much all you need to know  storywise  as director/writer Nolan will deliver the rest and while the end result wasn't a pure masterpiece to me  there's no way you can deny the power it does contain. Dreams have always played an interesting part in movies but no other has taken you this far into them and delivered such incredible ideas. Not only does the screenplay deliver a lot to think about but we also get plenty of action and amazing scenes of destruction. The trailer showed people just a little pinch of a city turning upside down but seeing the full sequence was something truly amazing. Other amazing sequences was the entire final hour when our group of dream breakers must enter a multiple layer of dreams with one damaging effect after another. If you're familiar with Nolan then you already know what he can do and there's no question the man has talent but it is something special that a film like this could be pulled off at all. When you're dealing with multiple characters in multiple spaces and in multiple dream zones it would be easy and common for things to just fall apart under their own weight. It's very difficult to keep you guessing from one moment to another without things either falling apart or getting so complicated that the viewer simply gives up on the film and moves on. The amazing thing is that Nolan never lets up on the gas and instead just delivers one more bit of story on top of the next and I thought it was amazing that he could keep the viewing coming along for the ride and never lose us. I think some people are going to not understand what's going on or be able to figure out the multiple levels but when you kick back and think about what you've seen I think most will see that the maze had an entrance and an exit and nothing came as a cheat. DiCaprio delivers yet another wonderful performance but he's got a terrific cast around him including Ellen Page  Michael Caine  Joseph Gordon-Levitt  Marion Cotillard  Cilliam Murphy  Pete Postlethwaite and a great return from Tom Berenger. Each actor does fine work in their roles and certainly help the story move along. The nature of the story is a very good one but the visual effects are just as good. Looking at all the action and amazing effects makes one really appreciate the acting  directing and story even more simply because they didn't get lost behind everything else that was going on. I don't think there's any question that one needs more than a single viewing to catch everything happening here but that's certainly not a bad thing since each viewing will deliver bits and pieces that will probably take the film into directions that you didn't think were there.",positive

That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art  it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all  the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened  only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing  it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels.

But first things first: The writer and direcctor here is of course Christopher Nolan and his British/American production from 2010 is maybe still his defining effort ten years later. They are showing this in theaters now again for said tenth anniversary and I happily took the chance to give it another watch  my third in fact and it definitely was not worse than my first or second. This is the kind of film that is indeed a lot better to be seen on the big screen  not only  but also because of the special effects. This movie won four Oscars  so also a big success with awards bodies  especially because it took home 150 more awards and over 200 more nominations and that is just what is listed here on imdb. Still I remember many people outraged back then because the one thing it did not get was an Oscar nomination for Nolan himself as director despite getting in at pretty much every important precursor. However  now in 2020  he also has his director nod and for this film here he got the writing nomination at least and that is absolutely alright because I think that the writing is the film's best aspect probably. Utter genius involved here and even more impressive if it was Nolan all on his own apparently.No Oscar nominations for the cast here. I think the only one who was slightly considered was Marion Cotillard and I would have liked it. She was really good  but then again I am a fan of her anyway. But it wasn't meant to happen and that is perfectly fine. She has one trophy already anyway  also did back then  which maybe helped her also in terms of getting cast here. She is one of several cast members that have worked with Nolan on other occasions before or after this movie  even if I think her portrayal in the final Batman film did not receive such positive acclaim overall. Oh well  others would be Murphy  Hardy and of course Michael Caine  who only has very little screen time here  two scenes and his second scene only lasts for a few seconds  but the first is really nice when his character meets the protagonist. Then there's a few actors whose star has gone down a bit in the last 10 years since this movie was made. Murphy may fit the description too to some extent  but I mostly mean the younger folks like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page. And Pete Postlethwaite is already dead for a few years  a bit sad knowing that now with how we see his character here dying too. May he rest in peace. But speaking of JGL  his role here is a bit of an example why he would never make it big in Hollywood. His character so plays second fiddle to Leonardo DiCaprio that it was a bit embarrassing almost here and there and among the weaker components of the film. Take the very early part already how he is trying so hard to convince Watanabe's character  while Leo knows his value and is all smooth and cool. Or how JGL is the one being caught and used to put pressure on Cobb (Leo) and even gets a bullet in the head. Or how he falls from the chair  kicked by Hardy I think  to elaborate on another phenomenon how people wake up from dreams. Oh yes  Watanabe I mentioned. Him I liked and like in general as an actor. I wish his character could have had more screen time to be honest  but his injury got in the way  but as we were sliding down the spheres  he gets better again. Still a bit strange how he so effortlessly turns into good guy and part of the team while being the antagonist before that and also with no real knowledge on the subject accompanies the thieves in their crucial endeavor involving Murphy's character. He was not really needed though.Another character who becomes part of the gang is Ellen Page's. She had some good moments and some not so good moments. Definitely not on par with the one other significant female character here  namely Cotillard's  but overall she is alright. The conscience scene with the ""people"" looking at her with angry faces is among the most memorable of the entire film. How she pushes these huge mirrors in position to show us the concept of going deeper and deeper into the mind  layer by layer  was also really good. But the idea that she really joins the gang too is already difficult to believe  but her return and talk about utter creation make me almost forget about it. What I cannot forget  however  is her final idea to step down to the bottom layer where Watanabe's character is lost. They acted as if this layer was simply too tough to take and then minutes later they are like okay well no biggie  let's go there and fix everything. The real final antagonist  namely Hal (Cotillard)  waiting there alone sure cannot justify their initial thoughts about that layer and its impact. As for Cotillard's character  of course the French music was a pretty telling inclusion again linked to her previous Oscar-winning movie for sure. Everybody who saw that one  must have made the connection. Anyway  speaking of Page's character again  kinda telling that she gets an implied romantic relationship with the kiss moment between her character and JGL's. That was one of the very few funny moments and that is fine. It was okay  but no need to stretch it or turn it into a romance movie. Nolan has many other  bigger strengths and I am glad he focused on these.Also in my showing  some people laughed at everything they got the chance to laugh at. It was pretty embarrassing. They knew nothing about movie quality. Anyway  Nolan's biggest strength here is the attention to detail. As good as the overall concept may be  the best thing is what he did with these small moments  such as the carpet having the wrong material and we realize it is just a dream within a dream. There are many other examples  such as everything involving Hardy's character too. He also brought in some comedy  like when he is that lady or when he guns down the enemy and tells JGL's character to think big. But the overall concept is just as good  the idea of how being killed in a dream makes you wake up  all the layers  or the idea how we do not remember the beginning of a dream (how did the two get there?) and a lot more. Nolan's script really oozes brilliance and creativity here and I would have been totally fine with it winning a fifth Oscar. Or even with the film winning Best Picture  which it admittedly never had a shot at. But the concept of dreaming and how little we and science know about it now in the 21st century is something that has fascinated me for a long time really  especially because I am a very heavy and intense dreamer myself. So exactly my cup of tea this movie and maybe people with little interest in the overall idea will like it less. Or maybe not  if we take a look at the really high rating here on imdb and this really high ranking up in the top250. Not undeserving. Nolan created a world of genius.At the same time  away from all the sci-fi  he also managed to create a touching story between Cobb and Hal. The scene when she jumps down from the roof is of course especially haunting  but also how we never see their children's faces in the dream because Cobb refuses to until he sees them in reality. And does so in the end. Happy end? Maybe. But to me it all felt so rushed with how he meets the old self of Watanabe's character (by the way the quote about how he simply bought the airline was another great comedic moment  maybe Nolan is not as bad as I thought and should finally make a 100% comedy movie)  turns him into a young man again within seconds and they all wake up inside the plane and even Murphy's character makes his peace again with his old man. And finally Cobb can  thanks to the Asian's help  get back to America and see his kids and then we see the swirling totem. Hal's totem. Does that mean we are indeed in her dream still. It could be with Nolan poking fun at unrealistic (in the truest sense of the word) rushed endings and nothing we saw was reality. Was Hal right all along? That's the good thing here. There is no 100% right or wrong. No 100% true or false and even if you watch this film ten times  you will still find something new you have not come across before  something new that can help you develop new creative approaches to the film and the reality depicted therein. Also have you ever asked yourself if you are in a dream yourself because when you are dreaming  then you usually don't know  so who says it couldn't be one we are all in right now. Anyway  this should be almost enough now with the review. You hopefully understood how much I liked this film.Just a few more snippets of information: 2010 was an amazing year for DiCaprio because he also appeared in Scorsese's ""Shutter Island""  another brilliant movie about the distorted human mind. I just mentioned the idea of totems. That I like as well  also with the additional idea that you should not let anybody touch your totem and how Cobb puts Page's character to a bit of a test there. Oh yes  another really smart reference the 1:10 proportion. One hour of dreaming equals ten hours of action in our dreams  which is why reality got slower and slower the further they dove down and how they showed it to us with the car crashing down the cliff (another happy ending that they are all saved) in fragments of 10% of a second maybe with all that has been going on underneath in the meantime was another stroke of genius for sure. There is so much to like here  it is pretty unreal. I am generally not a huge action film fan  but the very action-packed sequence in the icy region was good too. What can I say? I just like snow. Even if they had preferred an island in the sun or so. Another comedic moment. Alright. I think I'll leave it at that  even if there are another dozen moments at least so full of wit and creativity (just like myself) that they deserve elaboration on  but I won't because you need to watch it yourself instead!",positive

I do not understand the hype surrounding this film  probably the fruit of the market campaign of smart producers that lure naive viewers that seem that does not think and understand how flawed and stupid this story is. The plot is developed in fast pace to force the viewer to not think  with incoherent rules that do no make sense and that change in each layer of the dream in accordance with the intention of the writer. The best part of this film is the hilarious IMDb User Rating that reflects how brainless the Hollywood cinema has become in the contemporary days.

36,Inception,2010,PG-13,2h 28min,Action; Adventure; Sci-Fi; ,16 July 2010 (USA),9,1981675,3820,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/8X8J8sNXmCWDBaxo3vueONLRj00=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p7825626_p_v8_af.jpg,0,Not all the hype suggests but still an enjoyable action thriller built on a good concept and encourages thought afterwards,2010-08-02,"The important thing to start out with is to distance yourself from the hype about this film because it will not help you when watching it  nor is any of it totally justified. It seems that any mainstream film (especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not great to be expecting something impossible to follow  because again the film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring across several ""levels"" at once  I still found it easy to follow.The film is a thriller and  like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused questions throughout  but personally I found it easy to follow for the most part – and not because I'm smart but because the film does a good job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of being an action movie  the second half of the film does pick this up well and the race against time across all of the dream levels  with the editing bringing it all together well so that you don't lose what is happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the dream worlds are a bit too ""ordinary"" at times (most of our dreams are filled with things that don't make any sense or have echoes of things  rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The importance of Cobb's subconscious and in particular his own gnawing guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of having a repeatable ""baddie"" turning up in various places throughout the film  but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else  the ending of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of the ending. Personally I think that ""was the real level actually a dream"" is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going ""or was it?"" without providing much more than the question  but I choose to see this as just another tease  which he is perfectly allowed to do since the whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and change their own minds by themselves (although not really).The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to ""come in"" with and she works that angle well. Hardy  Watanabe and Rao round out the team well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by virtue of ""oh look its x"" but Caine  Berenger  Haas and Postlethwaite didn't really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked her better than I thought I would.I'm not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are  but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn't – pay attention. Doesn't quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film.",positive

A Japanese business man wants Dicaprio to enter the mind of a competitor and place an idea in his head to break up his empire. In exchange Dicaprio (Dom Cobb) would be allowed to go home to his family. Cobb first gets an architect (Ellen Page) who can design a complex location  such as a dungeon master creating the stage. He then must assemble a team of people with different skills to navigate through the dream world.The beginning of the movie is a bit confusing as you don't know what is real and what is a dream. However this shortly clears up. Dom Cobb has a lot of issues concerning his past life and dreamworld which jeopardizes the mission. His dead wife keeps showing up to foil his plans and he just hasn't the heart to kill her. The dreamworld works like a narcotic. Once you go into it  reality becomes boring.

Don't expect me to answer that. Don't expect the movie to be everything. It can not be. And don't assume  just because you liked/hated the movie  everyone else should feel the same way. Nor just assume that you can pinpoint every viewer or put everybody in 3 categories. People are far too complex to analyze and put into one category.What I mean by that  is that you can like this and Transformers. Or hate both. You can also over-analyze this movie and list it's flaws (yes it has them as every movie has them and depending on your view of it  you might spot them and care or not)  but apart from being visually stunning  it has a breathtaking story. And an ending that has been spoofed (at various internet sites)  but that works very fine for the movie. Of course you could also feel that the end is a cheat. But again  I cannot tell you how to feel about this movie (or any other movie for that matter)  I can only tell you  that it looks amazing and it made me chuckle for quite a few minutes in a breath-taking sequence.And no I did not get everything when I first watched it. I watched it a second time and there are still questions unanswered. Does or would something like that bother you? I didn't bother and the movie fully matched the expectations I had (this was my number 1 expected movie for 2010  the second most expected being ""Wall Street 2"").

That's because the picture moves across various levels and back again over the course of the story  and though it may seem confusing  you'll be OK if you keep in mind the premises offered by the inception team - DiCaprio  Levitt  Hardy  Page and Rao. I'm purposely leaving off Watanabe because he was by his own admission a 'tourist' and had a stake in the outcome.In a movie universe that's virtually impossible to crack with something original  this is the most creative picture I've seen in a long time. Like an intriguing time-travel story  this one grabs hold of the imagination and allows one to consider the possibilities of an alternate reality. The closer technology brings us to these cutting edge barriers of time  space and mind  the more fantastic becomes the possibility of turning virtual reality into the real thing.The movie's strongest feature is it's exposition. The characters both show and tell the viewer what to expect  quite unusual when it comes to the 'tell' part  because we usually rely on the development of the characters and the events they experience to bring us along for the ride. The concepts here are much more esoteric  especially when attempting to layer the events of the story in a 'dream within a dream' construct. For the most part  I think this was all done quite cleverly  but again  you have to pay attention.It would be tough to come up with the most interesting concept touched on by director Nolan  but the one that intrigued me the most was the idea of the dreamer having the ability to block an extraction. In Fischer's (Cillian Murphy) case  his training foresaw the need to 'militarize' his subconscious against attack  thereby creating 'projections' that in turn attacked the inception team. Another clever idea involved the zero gravity effects of participants in the Level Two dream during the Fischer inception. This is all done with such frenetic skill that it's sometimes tough to keep up with  although repeat viewings clear up what may have been missed the first time around. Another hint - use the captions on your DVD to capture all the dialog. The players tell you a lot of what you need to know to follow the story.I don't want to go too far out on a limb and tell you this is the greatest thing since sliced bread  because I know the film won't appeal to everyone. However enthusiasts of good science fiction will find a lot to like here  as it invites the viewer to expand one's consciousness and dream of the possibilities. Seriously folks  no one had to plant the idea  it just came out like that.,negative

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb  who has the technology to enter people's dreams to obtain secret information. The climax comes when Cobb and his cohorts enter the dream of an executive  going deeper and deeper into his subconscious.Despite the high action  ""Inception"" is not really an action movie  but more of a psychological thriller. The movie has a slightly nonlinear plot  similar to ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"". This helps to stress the dreamlike state that the movie depicts. If in fact the movie has any problem  it's that it's sometimes hard to tell when the characters are dreaming and when it's real life. But on the other hand  this also shows how smoothly Nolan lets the story flow. Watching the movie  I came to realize things about my own dreams that I had never previously thought about. The apparent descent into insanity and links to Cobb's past bring to mind ""Insomnia"".Much like how Nolan put a new spin on the Batman franchise  ""Inception"" takes psychological thrillers to the next step. It even goes beyond ""The Matrix"". All in all  I certainly recommend it.Also starring Ken Watanabe  Joseph Gordon-Levitt  Marion Cotillard  Ellen Page  Tom Hardy  Cillian Murphy  Dileep Rao  Tom Berenger and Michael Caine (who has so far starred in every one of Nolan's movies since ""Batman Begins"").",positive

That is unheard of. Not to say it is not a great film  but I am a little shocked by this. I give it an 8...Long story short  Christopher Nolan is a genius. He has a ton of films on the top 250 list  and still has along career ahead of him. This film was both written and directed by him  and the story and visuals are striking. Some of the story I think is a bit iffy (if you are too critical it might have major holes) but if you are accepting its basic premise  it is a solid concept that has not been explored before.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb  and Leo is always a good lead. The family issues here tread close to where ""Shutter Island"" tread  but this only shows where that other film fell short (as much as I enjoyed both).Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur  and was for me the most pleasant surprise of the film. I still have a hard time accepting him as a legitimate actor and not just a cheesy  comedic character. But here I was moved. He did his own stunts during what was by far my favorite scene of the film  and although he still looks twenty (he was 29 at the time this film came out) he has lots of potential.Ellen Page was a decent Ariadne (her most adult role yet)  and it was nice to see Nolan veterans Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine back for more. And a special shout-out to Pete Postlethwaite (Maurice Fischer) in what was one of his very final roles.Anyway  a must-see if ever there was one in the last few years. 9 out of 10? Maybe. 6th greatest film ever? I don't know... but definitely one of those rare gems of the last decade.",positive

Basically  Dominic 'Dom' Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief who steals valuable secrets in dangerous extraction  he enters a person's subconscious in their dreams  when the mind is most vulnerable. He is troubled man however  haunted by the memory's of his past with wife Mallorie 'Mal' (Marion Cotillard) and their subconscious experiences  and he is dying to change his past via the dream state. Saito (Batman Begins' Ken Watanabe) is offering him the chance of redemption by carrying out one last job using the subconscious entry  an impossible mission called inception. This would involve entering the mind of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy)  who has gained control of the company his recently deceased father Maurice (Pete Postlethwaite) owned  and placing in his mind the idea to shut down this company. So Cobb assembles a crack team of experts in the field of dream extraction and knowledge of inception  including Arthur ((500) Days of Summer's Joseph Gordon-Levitt)  Ariadne (Juno's Ellen Page)  Eames (Tom Hardy) and Yusuf (Dileep Rao). To make sure the mission can succeed they plan to go into a dream lasting ten hours  the length of Fischer's regular plane journey  and they will be going through three layers of dream state  i.e. Dream within a dream within a dream. So the main dream is Fischer and his assistant Peter Browning (Platoon's Tom Berenger) caught as hostages  and Fischer is convinced Browning is keeping something about his father from him. Then the next dream is Fischer convinced by Cobb that someone is trying to get into his head for this big secret  and he agrees to go into a dream to find out what the big secret is. Of course the dream states collide with each other  so the main dream sees some car chases as distractions in the big maze  so gravity for example of the characters in sleep will come into play in the other dreams too. But also the big problem with Cobb being in the dream is that his thoughts are being projected into the dream as well  such as the appearance of his wife and kids  his wife even kills Fischer when they need him most  forcing Cobb to go into his own memory of dream. In the end  the big secret placed into Fischer's mind is that his father wanted him to go his own way and create another company  and Cobb manages to come out with Saito as themselves  and the past is changed for Cobb for the better. Also starring Sir Michael Caine as Miles and Witness's Lukas Haas as Nash. There is a thought hanging over you when you watch that you really have to concentrate  but at the same time it is quite easy to keep up with where you are. If you can keep up with it  like I did manage to  you are completely taken in by the great action sequences  the well chosen cast  the imaginative concept  and the brilliant special effects to make it all possible  a fantastic and cool science-fiction action thriller.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb  a man who goes into other people's dreams to steal their secrets. One day a man approaches him with a far more difficult proposition; he wants an idea planted in the mind of a business rival; an idea the man must think was his own. Cobb is initially less than keen to do the job but the man has promise that he can arrange for him to get home to his children; something he can't currently do because he is suspected of killing his wife. To do the job he must assemble a team and take his target into a dream designed my new recruit Ariadne. This is no ordinary dream though; it requires the team to enter a dream within a dream within a dream! It is complicated further by the facts that his dead wife haunts Cobb and that if any of them die in the dream they will be trapped in a limbo.Director Christopher Nolan ably demonstrates that a big blockbuster film doesn't need to be in 3D these days nor does it need to be devoid of complicated ideas to succeed. DiCaprio did a fine job as Cobb and it was nice to see the excellent Ellen Page playing somebody who wasn't still a schoolgirl! While this film was about ideas that doesn't mean it wasn't full of spectacular special effects; while many of them were clearly computer generated they looked real enough to enable the viewer to suspend their disbelief in a way that often isn't possible. The idea of dreams within dreams could have been very confusing but each dream was very different so the viewer doesn't forget which layer of the dream is which once the action begins. If you have being putting off watching this film because you have been put off by the hype don't worry and watch it now; it is great.,positive

Today  am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?"" Marcus Aurelius  the late Roman emperor and philosopher  wrote  ""Life is a dream  a little more coherent than most."" Freud concluded that dreams were the fulfillment of unconscious wishes that had managed to sneak past the dozing censor. Aboriginal Australians believed in a real parallel universe called The Dream Time in which everything and everyone who ever existed  still existed  and anybody could enter this place during sleep.Modern psychology believes that dreams are nothing more than random cortical bombardment caused by a lot of activity in sub-cortical structures associated with the filing of memories  and the cortex goes into overdrive trying to make narrative sense of them. Sex dreams are pleasant enough except when the furry little animals show up  but statistics demonstrate that the majority of dreams are truly lousy  the kind we can easily live without. Don't you get tired of running in slow motion through a swamp while being chased by an ogre? Does all this sound like pointless rambling to you? Well  then you're not going to enjoy ""Inception"" because it meanders at lightning speed all over the place and lives by no rules that human beings have ever known.On the other hand  if you find these adventitious allusions in some way interesting  then you should see this dark and muddled movie. You get a bonus too  because in its style it closely resembles an action movie from the 1980s. Everything is happening all at once -- or maybe not all at once. Who cares? The point is that people get shot in the forehead and buildings comes toppling down for no reason and slow-motion explosions take place at irregular but short intervals.I'm getting pretty tired of seeing films that use some bewildering metaphysical scheme as an excuse to show off still more CGIs.

Instead of the perfect heist  Cobb and his team of specialists (Joseph Gordon-Levitt   Elliot Page   Tom Hardy   Dileep Rao) have to pull off the reverse : their task is not to steal an idea  but to plant one. As Cobb is hired by a strange man named Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants Dom to implant something  a process called ""inception""  which is not easy to do. If they succeed  it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming . Enter a world beyond you wildest imagination where anything can happen ! . Mind is the scene of the crime . The dream is real . Whatever goes on in your dreams is no longer for your eyes only ! .

And now I know what all the fuzz was about.""Inception"" is simply put a groundbreaking movie for our times  just like ""Matrix"" was back in 1999.The story told in ""Inception"" is very captivating and you get really caught up in the events as they unfold. The story is the type that grips you tight and takes you on one amazing thrill ride. I will not go into depth about the actual storyline  but the notion about going into another person's subconscious and dreams is quite interesting. And going in there to plant the seed of a new idea is even more interesting. Enough said.As for the cast in ""Inception""  well that was simply phenomenal. Lots of really good performances done here  but of course  we are dealing with good actors and established names here. Of course Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role as Cobb. I haven't been much fond of his previous work  but since ""Shutter Island""  he has really started to become noticeable (for me at least). And his performance in ""Inception"" was right on the money  very nice indeed. Of course  he wasn't the sole carrier of the movie  he was well helped along by Joseph Gordon-Levitt  playing Arthur  and he was really standing out on the screen. He did such a super job with his character  and I think he was the one actually carrying the heavy load of the movie. Then there was Ellen Page  playing Ariadne  which was quite an interesting role to see her in. Actually  the list goes on and on with really good actors here  such as Ken Watanabe  Michael Caine  Cillian Murphy  and so on.What appealed to me about the movie was the concept of the entire story. Of being able to go into a person's mind and influence his dreams and thoughts. However unlikely it may be  it still came off quite nice on the screen.A movie like this is nothing without special effects. And ""Inception"" sure had a bunch of really nice effects along the way. There were some really mind-boggling CGI effects going on at places. And the effects also had a huge part to do with the final outcome of the movie.Despite it being a rather long movie  the time does fly by as you watch it  because you are so caught up in the story. And that was really great  film-making when it is best; entertainment that makes you forget all about time and space. And ""Inception"" is definitely a movie that you need to get around to watch if you haven't already seen it. This is a movie that will redefine movie making in the future.Thumbs up  way up  for this impressive movie.",positive

Dream on.,2011-04-04,At what point does a film become too complicated for its own good? In the case of Inception  almost immediately: in a bid to make the ultimate 'mind-f**k' movie  writer/director Christopher Nolan starts his film at 'bloody confusing' and  over the course of 148 excruciatingly drawn-out minutes  works his way up to 'completely and utterly unfathomable' before leaving the film on a predictably ambiguous note (thus allowing endless discussion on movie forums).Along the way  Nolan introduces many an intriguing idea  but the ones that haven't been nicked from far better movies (eXistenZ  Vanilla Sky  The Matrix  Dark City  Cypher) are so half-baked that the film inevitably becomes a frustrating mess of contradiction and contrivance which conjures up an endless stream of questions (see IMDb's FAQs)  none of which seem to have any satisfying answers (despite the best efforts of Nolan's rabid fan-boys).Lost in Inception's labyrinthine plot  all I could do was sit back and marvel at the special effects—which are undeniably impressive—whilst asking myself repeatedly how Ariadne (Ellen Page) became such a great architect despite no actual work experience  and whether such a pretty young woman would really be happy to be sedated in a grubby warehouse by a group of suspicious looking strangers. Somehow  I doubt it.5 out of 10 for its jaw-dropping effects (in particular  the awesome gravity-defying fight scene)  and I reckon that's being generous.,positive

These days  if a film is complexly-layered it is automatically deemed art...not popcorn entertainment ready for mass consumption  but high art. If ""small minds"" are unable to grasp the film's deeper meanings  those poor folks are disregarded as unworthy participants in the ultimate game. ""Inception"" is a game--and  at times  a grand one--but it isn't a masterpiece. It's a gun-crazy  gadget-mad  hyperactive Rubik's Cube of a movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the grieving Cobb  a dream extractor who enters into the sleeping minds of others to gather vital information which cannot be obtained any other way. Unfortunately  memories of his late wife (and guilt over her mysterious death) are so vivid they are permeating Cobb's subconscious; and inevitably those haunted images follow him helplessly on his jaunts into the dream-state. The movie has very little exposition  with a confusing prologue later revealed to be the starter threads to the epilogue  and doesn't really get going until we are introduced to Cobb's latest case involving a dying billionaire  his crestfallen son  and the final draft of the tycoon's will which is locked up in a safe no one knows the combination to. The other participants in the project are a brainy  adept  and engaging group of people we become quite fond of; often times  particularly in a perplexing movie such as this one  having such smart  savvy characters populating the scenario makes the ride that much more enjoyable (not forgetting of course that humans are never so vulnerable to danger as when they are asleep). What doesn't really work are the constant sniper attacks in the dreams--projections which manifest themselves as an angry militia--as well as a visual impersonation of the son's godfather  which is necessary to the plot but becomes little more than a complicated footnote. The level of dreams our heroes pass through  one more dangerous than the last  provide the picture with a visual kick  and the nonchalant manner in which the characters respond to their strange new surroundings accent ""Inception"" with a giddiness not usually found in big-budget action films. I'm not sure whether or not Christopher Nolan violates his own movie-rules in order to cap the film with an emotional bow  but he does get solid performances from his cast  a rich and delectable production design from his art department  and swirling  hallucinogenic special effects from his creative team. Is the movie a mind-blowing experience? For many audiences  it certainly will be. As with all 'summer epics' and popcorn crowd-pleasers  this one's crazy glow will probably fade in the stretch (I can't imagine the film will hold up so well once it goes the home-video route--it's a theatrical experience  after all). It is not a work of art  however that doesn't mean it isn't sheer pleasure from start to finish. *** from ****",positive

Many like to see a movie once  maybe take a few calls or texts during its running time  and never feel like they miss anything. And  when it is over  they are happy with the experience. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that type of movie-watching.However  that type will not do well with ""Inception."" This movie is more for those of us who like to watch every bit of every scene  hear every word of dialog  and try to piece together a fairly complex story. Some can watch 'Inception' through just once and get everything  and I applaud them for that. But I needed to see it maybe four times  over an almost two year period  to appreciate fully how good it is. Leonardo DiCaprio is in the lead role as Cobb  he has become an expert in ""extraction""  the surely illegal activity of going into dreams with others and in the process extract some secret or other information. A good use for such a talent is industrial and business espionage.But Cobb has a new client that approaches him for the opposite task  the insertion of an idea into the target's mind  and in this case make the subject think it was his own idea. That is the process they call ""Inception."" The idea for the story and resultant film was an approximate 10-year process for the writer/director Nolan. Much of the details are derived from his own dream experiences  such as what may seem like a day or week in a dream might be just a fraction of a minute in real time  and a familiar sound or loss of equilibrium might bring you out of your dream. The client that hires Cobb is Ken Watanabe as Saito. The subject is Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer  whose industrialist father is about to die  and if the company is not forced to break into smaller units they will monopolize their market. The task is to  through inception  convince Robert that breaking the now his company into smaller units is his idea. To do that is a very complex task  and requires meticulous planning and several levels of dreams. All does not go as planned  unexpected assassins tail them  and all this provides for the drama and action.Another layer of intrigue is added by Cobb's situation  where his wife had died some time before but he was blamed  and as a result he has not been able to travel back to his home and children in the USA. He still sees her  in dreams  often when he doesn't really want to  while she tries to convince him they are not really in a dream  but real.Cobb's team members include Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur  Ellen Page as Ariadne  Tom Hardy as Eames  and Dileep Rao as the chemist for the sedative drugs  Yusuf.His wife is Marion Cotillard as Mal.I like this movie a lot  there is so much in it that I see many 'new' things each time. I look forward to seeing it again several times  maybe 6 to 12 months between viewings. I have it on Blu-ray and the video and audio are just state-of-the-art.

After Mulholland Drive  I spent hours on the Internet  and then I had to watch it again. A great film but man was I lost.I'm sure this sounds funny to many young IMBb members  who see this kind of film all the time  but this Casablanca fan gets confused easily. For that  I thank writer/director Christopher Nolan  whose scripts for ""The Prestige "" ""Memento "" and ""Batman Begins "" I absolutely loved. He's really a favorite.Another favorite of mine is the ever-boyish Leonardo DiCaprio  who is a wonderful actor and gives a great performance in his role  ably supported by the always excellent Marion Cotillard  Cillian Murphy (a new favorite)  and the rest of the cast.Someone somewhere who hated this movie said that anyone who thought Nolan was trying to say something serious is crazy. I don't know if he was or not  but I think the whole subject of the subconscious and the dream state and creating a reality are intriguing topics. Many do question is our whole reality on earth is a dream. Not sure ""Inception"" really answers that  but it's an absorbing film.",positive

It also is one of the highest rated films ever on IMDB. And  so much has been said about the film  I think I'll be rather brief.The plot involves a guy who learns that nothing be sees or does is real...and that the world is nothing like anyone thinks. This is because in the dystopian future  machines keep folks in pods and they live out their lives in a phony existence.The film's story is interesting...and very existential. I like that aspect of it very much. But the film has a weakness for me and I am sure some other folks might feel the same way...there is just too much action. The film is one scene after another after another--with lots of action  violence and CGI...so much that it boggles the mind. For me  that left me rather tired when the film was over.

This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put  the film looks amazing in its audacious production design  dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist  super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking  and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly  while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes  mysticism  philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited  and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy  Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds  this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler  certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles)  an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up  not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels  both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Well  let me tell you: it's a crowd-pleasing science fiction adventure  which took audiences by surprise as it came out of nowhere and totally destroyed the year's other big sci-fi epic  THE PHANTOM MENACE. The reason for its success is quite obvious when you look at it. The film isn't just about special effects  although they do play a big part; it also has a rather complex and classic sci-fi set up. While STAR WARS was all bad special effects and little else  THE MATRIX is all good special effects and a lot more besides.Okay  so there are some obvious flaws: a lack of originality for one; the real futuristic world looks like something out of BLADE RUNNER and there are bits out of DARK CITY thrown in too. The story  too  once it has been set up  is dropped in favour of some increasingly outlandish action sequences. But when these action scenes are fantastic  then you just don't care. After all  I watch a film to be entertained  and fighting and explosions are the simplest source of entertainment around.The actors and actresses in the film are all okay  although you have to wonder if Carrie-Anne Moss was picked simply because she looks good in PVC. No matter  as it's left to Keanu Reeves in his best role for some time  to carry the film. While he may not be much of an actor (the sheer awfulness of his performance in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is hard to forget)  he just about manages to make his role as a mild-mannered computer operator who becomes a heroic saviour believable. Thankfully  there is some heavyweight support from Laurence Fishburne as the imposing leader of the rebels  and a wonderfully villainous performance from Hugo Weaving as the slimy villain. The costumes are great too - stylish leather and sunglasses making up the main attire.The film is not really about acting  though  or story. It's the special effects which make this  well  special. Without them  it would just be another average tale  but these CGI effects are truly outstanding  even on the small screen. For once  they do fit into the context of the story as well  as they are computer effects in a computer generated world. THE MATRIX has brilliant CGI  and has to join the ranks of TERMINATOR 2  JURASSIC PARK  and INDEPENDENCE DAY as a film which really sets the ever-changing standard on which all other films are to be based.Bullets fly in slow-motion  leaving trails in the air; characters can spin in the air  climb walls and jump huge distances; computer-generated villains morph into other people at will  fights are impossibly fast. Indeed  it is the fight scenes which are the most memorable  as they come across as a hybrid of the classic kung fu genre and the very best of style master John Woo. The best moments are the Fishburne/Reeves training fight  the moment where Reeves takes on Agent Smith in a subway  and the lobby shootout where plaster literally flies everywhere. You also have to love the ending  where Reeves finally wins over the baddies and manages to stop bullets mid-flight with his bare hand. A great image  just one of loads in this great film which has to be one of my favourite sci-fi films of the decade.,positive

Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget  the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects.,positive

So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah  not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom  we find out later  are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene.

Yes. Groundbreaking? Not really.,2014-11-29,"15 years ago  back in the 20th century  the first of so far three Matrix films was released. It runs for roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes and was directed by the Wachowski brothers Andy and Lana (still Larry back then). The film stars Keanu Reeves with supporting performances by Carrie Anne Moss  Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving.I cannot say I didn't enjoy this film as I really liked it to some extent  but I was not wowed either  maybe because science fiction is not exactly my favorite genre. My biggest problem was possibly Reeves in the lead role. I just fail to see him as a guy who brings the necessary toughness for his character here and in any other action movie. All this praise about him being the chosen one made me cringe occasionally. The dialogs about him being so grand were sometimes downright cheesy and same goes for the explosions coming with the final kiss between Reeves' and Moss' characters. Another criticism I had was the Oracle being wrong. She was presented as a know-it-all authority and in the end her prediction is simply disregarded with the explanation  Neo has to find his way and then he is the chosen one if he chooses to be. Oh and the song during the closing credits did not match my taste at all.What I did like about the film were basically all the supporting players  especially Fishburne and Moss also. The helper-turned-villain was creepy in his big scene and Weaving was a revelation. His antagonist really makes the film and the film was at its best during the scenes he was in. The camera shot with Weaving before the subway train runs over him was certainly the best shot of the movie  maybe the whole trilogy. His parallel on humans being the real virus of the planet makes you wonder too if he is maybe right. Other than that  I liked the pill reference from ""Alice in Wonderland"" early on and the green code on black ground is certainly memorable and immediately associated with this film.Finally  I would like to say that I recommend this movie  especially to sci-fi lovers although they probably have seen it already anyway. It is not a film I really want to rewatch anytime soon  but it starts okay and gets better during the second half. I don't think the second and third Matrix films are much worse  but that is maybe because I don't consider the first a masterpiece. All three are solid. ""The Matrix"" won four technical Academy Awards  all four categories where it was nominated. It's no ""Return of the King""  but still an admirable achievement.",positive

The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.The film is cool  it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.,negative

When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police.  However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body  and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy.  Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface  however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods.  Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.Has anyone not seen this?  The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero.  That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix  Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones.  The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing.  The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake.  Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.The action is fantastic.  After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here.  Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels.  The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT.  The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too).  Reeves is cool and is suited to the role.  Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on?  Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on.  Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden.  Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind  Trinity is a character etc etc.  How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted.  The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree.  However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch.  For me  I can't wait for the sequels.,positive

And the Matrix is what came out. A great sci-fi movie  that has many elements from other movies (and a theme we have also seen in horror movies)  put well together.While I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan  he does convince here (as he did in Speed). So while he is in action territory  there is always fun to be had with him. Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne have great supporting roles  although of course it is more stylish adventure than anything else. And while the movie leaves quite a few questions open you might have  it works for the movie  being only told a minimum amount of plot. The Keanu Reeves character acts as the viewer as he is thrown in an unknown world. Being baffled and stunned by the whole thing  this might be the reason his casting works so good ...Apart from that  the action is amazing (Yuen Woo-Ping  very well known for his Asian/martial arts choreography's)  the set pieces and the dystopia feel of the movie is pretty convincing ...Edit: the above review is from 21 July 2009 - before I went to watch the new (fourth) installment in this ... triolgy (?)  I revisited the Matrix - Matrix revisited - to use the Matrix title name game. I stand by what I have written above. The cultural impact the movie had is enormous and that is putting it mildly. Back then nobody knew the brothers would become sisters  but I don't think that should play a role on what I wrote or what you think about the movie.If you watch it under that aspect and also including the rumor that the Neo character was supposed to also be female at certain realities (or worlds) - also considering how Trinity is more centred and more masculine in a sense .. and how some feel that the connection between Neo and Trinity is more like a brother and sister energy ... well in hindsight there may have been some things we could ascribe to the siblings Wachowski ... quite a few to be honest. Which might bring us to the whole Luke and Leia thing ... but let's not get too psychological here.As written above  I do not feel that Keanu Reeves is the strongest ""actor"". That being said  he is more than a cool Dude. Although even in this and having seen it a few times now  he does play quite the intriguing fool. No pun and no offense intended. Even a character tells him that he sure isn't the brightest. Again that is about the character he portrays and is not meant to describe Keanu or his intellectual abilities.The Matrix changed the game ... it was also the driver for the then new format  called DVD. It would have been quite something if the new Matrix would have made the 4k discs popular ... but you can't capture lightning in a bottle twice. More on this on the new films page though. This has its flaws for sure (inner logic and all that)  but overall it is more than a winner. Bullet time  Hugo Weaving  Laurence Fishburn ... and the philosophical questions combined make for a great cocktail ... after they've been put in the blender with many other ingredients of course ... and the circle is completed once again.",positive

Watching today  it still holds up as an exciting sci-fi action thriller  with effects that still look relatively new even though many of them have been copied and even parodied since. I have to admit  time travel  dream stories and virtual reality films can leave you with your head hurting a bit  but if you watch this one attentively  you'll find that it was cleverly written leaving very little wiggle room for plot holes to creep through.Essentially  'The Matrix' is a computer generated dream world which replaced the 'real' world that was destroyed at some point during the twenty second century in a battle between humans and an artificial intelligence. The AI won  and subsequently created an entire race of machines feeding off the living energy of humans kept alive in a state of suspended animation. The very few humans still alive wait for the day that 'The One' will destroy the Matrix and free those under it's control. To protect itself  The Matrix has created a race of machines called Sentinels who track down humans  be it in the real world or in The Matrix itself. This can all get a little confusing  so it's best to take this all in with no distraction  because things move back and forth between the two realms rather quickly.If you really want to take the concept of the picture a step further  there's plenty here to dissect and analyze. For some  the religious and philosophical elements conveyed by The Matrix and The One are quite overt. One of the immediate thoughts that struck me was the parallel of The Matrix to The Force in ""Star Wars""  an eternal and universal life energy that unites all living creatures. The One can be interpreted as The Savior  the Redeemer of Mankind who will set all of humanity free from the curse of original sin  or in this case  the slavery of the pods. I guess if you're skeptical of this philosophic/religious connection  this will all be a lot of mumbo-jumbo  but to me it's a lot more interesting to look at it that way than just seeing a bunch of special effects involving insane martial arts moves and time stopping bullets in flight.What I didn't care for so much was the make up of the Sentinels  not the human ones but the machines. Personally  I thought Hugo Weaving was great as Agent Smith in his relentless pursuit of Neo. But the idea of those squid-like battle ships attacking the Nebuchadnezzar seemed to defy a certain logic. Wasn't Zion  the last human city located underground? The concept of The Oracle also catches one a bit off guard as well. I mean  my idea of an Oracle  who was supposed to know everything about The Resistance since the beginning  wasn't exactly that of an old woman who smokes cigarettes and bakes cookies. This introduction of a bit of whimsy might have been intriguing to the Wachowski Brothers  so if that's the case  I guess I can go along with it.Anyway  I like the idea of The Matrix and I like the movie. I can't say as much about the sequels  and it's been some time since I've seen those as well. I'll get around to them again eventually.",positive

Basically  in an abandoned hotel in a major city  Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is cornered by the police but overpowers them with superhuman abilities. He is chased whilst fleeing by the police and a group of black suited Agents  with similar superhuman abilities. She escapes by answering a ringing phone in a public telephone booth and vanishes. Computer programmer and hacker Thomas Anderson  known by his alias ""Neo"" (Keanu Reeves)  is confused by repeated online encounters with something called ""the Matrix""  and seeing the phrase ""Follow the White Rabbit"". He is approached by Trinity in a rave bar  she tells him he is in great danger  that they are watching him and that he is searching for answers  particularly to the most important question of all: what is the Matrix? The following morning  at Neo's job at Metacortex  a leading software company  a team of Agents and police  led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving)  arrive searching for him. Neo is contacted by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)  an infamous hacker  who attempts to guide him to safety  but he surrenders rather than risking his life trying to escape. The Agents attempt to coerce Neo into helping them locate Morpheus  who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses  the agents fuse his mouth shut and implant a robotic ""bug"" in his stomach. Neo awakens believing that he had a nightmare. Soon after  Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus  and she removes the bug from Neo  proving what he experienced was real. Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: the blue pill will return him to his former life  the red pill will reveal the truth about the Matrix. Neo chooses to take the red pill  his reality begins to distort  and he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others  containing other human beings. He is then brought aboard Morpheus' flying ship  the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod  Morpheus explains the situation: a war broke out between the human race and intelligent machines in the early 21st century  when the humans blocked the machines from accessing solar energy  the machines responded by capturing humans and harvesting their bioelectric power with their minds being trapped in the Matrix  a shared simulation of the real world that existed in 1999. The machines won the war  and the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to ""unplug"" enslaved humans and recruit them  and the Matrix's simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix would mean death to a real physical body  that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system  and  in the real world  machines called Sentinels are hunting the rebels. Morpheus virtually trains Neo with everything that is possible within the understanding of the Matrix  from kung fu fighting to firing weapons. Neo displays great ability and skill  cementing Morpheus' belief that he is ""The One""  a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle (Gloria Foster)  the prophet who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus' life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix  Agents and police have been tipped off by disgruntled crew member Cypher (Joe Pantoliano). He has tipped off the Agents to ambush the group in exchange to return to a comfortable life back in the Matrix. Morpheus buys time for the others by fighting with Agent Smith and is captured  while Mouse (Matt Doran) is shot to death. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders crew members Apoc (Julian Arahanga) and Switch (Belinda McClory)  while they are unconscious and connected. Before he can kill Neo and Trinity  crew member Tank (Marcus Chong) regains consciousness and kills Cypher before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to gain the access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion  which would allow them to destroy it. Neo is determined to return to the Matrix to rescue him  as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she goes with him. While rescuing Morpheus  Neo gains confidence in his abilities  performing feats comparable to those of the Agents. As Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix  Smith ambushes and kills Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar  Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix  he then leaps into Smith's body and causes him to explode  while the other Agents flee. He makes it out of the Matrix just as the ship's EMP (electromagnetic pulse) is activated and disables the attacking Sentinels inside the ship. Back in the Matrix  Neo makes a telephone call  promising the machines that he will show their prisoners ""a world where anything is possible"". He hangs up and flies away. Also starring Anthony Ray Parker as Dozer  Paul Goddard as Agent Brown  Robert Taylor as Agent Jones  David Aston as Rhineheart  Marc Aden Gray as Choi  Ada Nicodemou as Dujoir (White Rabbit Girl) and Deni Gordon as Priestess. Reeves gives a good performance as the recluse who may be saviour of humanity from cyberspace slavery  Fishburne is really likeable as the inspirational leader and teacher  Moss is terrific as the beautiful feisty love interest  Weaving enjoys himself being the snarling villain  and Pantoliano does well in his time onscreen. You can just about follow what's going on if you really concentrate (the colouring  green for the Matrix world and blue for the real world  it certainly helps you decipher)  with complex theories of philosophy and ancient mysticism  otherwise you can just enjoy it for its thrilling fight and chase sequences  fast and slow-motion  spectacular special effects  and amazing visuals  an impressive and unmissable science-fiction action. It won the Oscars for Best Editing  Best Sound Effects Editing  Best Visual Effects  and Best Sound  and it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects  and Best Sound  and it was nominated for Best Cinematography  Best Editing  and Best Production Design. It was number 66 on 100 Years  100 Thrills  and it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",positive

I needn't have worried; I enjoyed it just as much as I did first time.The story begins with computer hacker Neo receiving strange message telling him somebody was about to knock on his door and that he should 'follow the white rabbit'; his door is knocked and his friends invite him to come out with him; he is about to refuse when he sees a white rabbit tattooed on one of their shoulders so goes with them. While out he meets another hacker  a woman called Trinity  who tells him that the legendary hacker Morpheus wants to meet with him. The next day at work he receives a call telling him the authorities want to take him into custody and he must follow precise instructions if he wishes to escape; he fails to do this and is arrested. During the interview with Agent Smith a strange bug is implanted and in a nightmarish manner his mouth becomes fused closed! The next thing he knows he is waking up in his apartment assuming it was just a strange nightmare but it soon becomes apparent that is was real. Taken to Morpheus by Trinity he learns that the world is not as it seems; he isn't in 1999 but 2199 and none of his life so far has been real; his body is plugged into a giant machine and he is experiencing something called The Matrix.Once woken he finds himself in a dead mechanical world with Morpheus  Trinity and a few other free people; they mention the last human city; Zion  but we never see it. Now he is free he must prepare to return to The Matrix which means learning the skills he will need to survive and gaining an understanding of what The Matrix really is. Once inside they will have to avoid Agents  parts of the program that will hunt them down as well as assuring that they stay hidden in the real world; if they die in either place their life is over.This is a must see for all science fiction and action fans; it has a fine story and spectacular action sequences; many of them reminiscent of those in Chinese Wuxia films with characters running up walls and doing impossible leaps... of course within The Matrix nothing is impossible if you believe you can do it. Keanu Reaves might not have the greatest acting range but he is just right for the role of Neo  a man understandably a little confused at finding everything he had experienced so far was unreal. Hugo Weaving is great as Agent Smith bringing a sense of menace to the role. Other main actors Carrie Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne also perform well. Writer/directors the Wachowski brothers did a great job; the film is incredibly stylish without lacking substance. I can't imagine many people haven't watched this but if you are one of those I strongly recommend checking it out.,positive

They lived up to their billing. Unfortunately  the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours  a bit too secular-minded for me  although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.Nonetheless  because of the stylish visuals and effects  it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best  or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard. Once again here's a movie that made you glad VHS tapes were being phased out in favor of sharper  widescreen transfers.,positive

Of course I have seen it before  back in the day when it was newly released. But I can't claim to have been much of a fan of the movie or the whole franchise actually. But I opted to sit down and watch them again  prior to sitting down to watch the newest addition to the franchise. But more about that one later.I never got onboard the 'Matrix is an amazing movie' train. Sure  I found the movie to be watchable  but it just wasn't an impressive movie in terms of script and storyline. So writers Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski didn't really impress me back in 1999  and nor was revisiting the movie here in 2021 an eye-opening experience. I just never could delve into that whole artificial reality where the laws of physics and such doesn't apply.Visually then ""The Matrix"" was impressive  no doubt about it. And even today  22 years later  the movie is actually still rather enjoyable in terms of visual effects and CGI. But a movie can only be sustained so much on visual effects alone.Something that definitely was impressive about ""The Matrix"" was the cast ensemble  because they had gotten together a great cast for the movie. Of course  Keanu Reeves is excellent in the movie  but then again  he does tend to have a track record of that. The movie also have the likes of Laurence Fishburne  Carrie-Anne Moss  Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano on the cast list. Now  back in the day I didn't really like Hugo Weaving  but I must admit that seeing the movie again definitely brings his monotonous performance of Agent Smith to a new light  because he did so rather phenomenally  and always was the star of the movie.I am not a fan of ""The Matrix"" franchise  nor will I ever become so. But I have to say that the amount of action in the movie and the execution of the action sequences was good  and the visual effects definitely helped to keep the movie afloat. But in terms of storyline and script  then ""The Matrix"" was sort of flawed and mundane.My rating of the 1999 action sci-fi from directors Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski lands on a six out of ten stars.",positive

For what it is  I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing  sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019  and I have seen it maybe 8 times  still a great  ground-breaking movie  I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)The DVD picture is perfect all the way through  and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But  the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor  special effects supervisor  and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed  you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or  you can play the musical soundtrack alone.All in all  a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD.

But  he soon meets Morpheus  played with great mysticism and wiseness by Laurence Fishburne  who brings Neo down the rabbit hole to tell him the truth about the world; we are living in a world called the Matrix  which uses out brain energy to trun us into batteries.  Unbelieveable to be sure  but it is incredibly original story wise  as it sprawls into something every average movie goer can appreciate- hard boiled  visually and bloody packed action  gore and violence.The best part though is that this film breaks many boundaries in technology and (with it's 4 Oscars for editing  sound  sound editing and visual effects) and deserves every bit of credit it gets.  True  some might find the plot confusing and boring and true it isn't for all tastes.  But if you can like the story and the action  you've got the key to a fantastic picture  otherwise it is another action flick (great action never-the-less).

Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them  but it does have the memorable characters  the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three  but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two  and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad.However  I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous  the costumes are splendid  the effects are great  the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score  what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore  his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here  sometimes even at the same time  as well as the charming Hobbits theme  the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.Now I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director  but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures  and this is no exception  where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope  with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman  the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue  which on the whole is excellent  Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it.And the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here  but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here  while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel  and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee  whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good  and indeed it was  and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir  and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here  here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really  as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen  who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf  the delivery to the camera  the delivery of the lines  perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom  yes he is dashing and handsome  but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland.In conclusion  a great start. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

R. R. Tolkien's novel (itself awarded the title of ""book of the century"")  bringing to the big screen a film nearly flawless in its execution. My biggest disappointment is that two chapters are missing from the novel - Tom Bombadil and the following encounter with the barrow-wrights - but everything else is present and correct.Visually the film is stunning  and Jackson's decision to shoot it entirely in New Zealand is one that pays off. From the incredibly lush green opening scenes of the Shire  to the enchanting elvish woods  to the imposing mountains and plains  it really is a great film to look at and enjoy the backdrop. Even the computer-generated images  like that of Mount Doom  are pretty realistic. Jackson's fluid camera leads to some great sweeping shots through orc-infested mines  huge towers  cameras in places you've never dreamed of. The soundtrack is also perfect  with Howard Shore's suspenseful  exciting  and emotional score a real plus  especially with the cool chanting that fills the Mines of Moria sequence. On top of this  great stuff is done with sound effects - in particular one scene involving a horn suddenly blowing had me jumping in my seat with its realism.I don't really need to examine the story  because it sticks closely to the book with so few minor changes that it's impeccable. The script is intelligent and well-written  the characters charismatic and believable in the situations they encounter. Despite a three hour running time  the film never drags  even in some of the slower sequences - I just didn't want it to be over while I was watching it. The costumes  sets and appearances - down to the hobbits' hairy feet - are all exactly as you would picture them in the book. Jackson's bizarre  arty depiction of life in the ""netherworld"" when Frodo puts on the ring and becomes invisible is as good as it could ever have been - spooky  supernatural and utterly weird. Lighting  pacing  suspense  tension  and the rest - it's all here and done 100% correctly for an overall brilliant effect.Elijah Wood seemed an odd choice to me for the lead role  but I immediately fell in love with his character. Through his acting he creates an emotional  weak in body but strong in spirit hero  a real centre piece for the film to evolve around  and the film makes great use of the actor's slightly odd eyes (especially in the sequence in which he nearly becomes a wraith). Ian McKellen is also excellent as Gandalf and seems to have been perfectly cast in the role  making it his own. Then there's the fellowship itself - Viggo Mortensen excels as the proud and just Strider (later Aragorn)  especially in the action stakes where he fights with such fierce determination that he's a presence to behold. Orlando Bloom is fine as the elf warrior Legolas  and moves as fast with his bow as he does in the book. Screen stalwart John Rhys-Davies IS Gimli the dwarf  and couldn't be better. Then there's Sean Astin - lovable as the dopey but loyal Sam Gamgee  and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan in slight comic relief roles as hobbit buddies Pip and Merry. Finally  kudos to Sean Bean  for creating in Boromir a flawed but deeply likable and understandable character  with a sympathetic performance that eclipses all of the actor's previous work - bravo.The action sequences are magnificent and really get the heart going - they put you into the middle of the action with all the blood  sweat and clanging steel  and are edge-of-the-seat stuff. Highlights include Strider fighting the ring-wraiths with his burning brand on Weathertop and the final assault by orcs on the fellowship  which leads to one of the most noble deaths ever in a film. And what of the special effects? In a film dominated by CGI work  I'm happy to say that most are unnoticeable. The digital manipulation to create four-foot hobbits is sometimes dodgy but most of the time you don't notice. The backdrops and effects are great  expensive looking but solid and real at the same time - whoever said they look ""cartoony"" just got it wrong.My favourite scene in the movie is the Mines of Moria sequence - a fantasy fan's dream come true  and the best on screen depiction of a Dungeons & Dragons game so far. The lurker in the lake is a Lovecraftian monster par excellence and the spooky and atmospheric trip through the corpse-strewn deserted mines exceptionally eerie stuff. Then follows a fantastic battle with a cave troll  thankfully on screen for a fair amount of time so we get to admire the fluid and superb effects  and then a truly gob-smacking encounter with the fiery Balrog  just as you imagine it from the book. This half an hour is probably the best film sequence I've ever seen  flawless and perfect in its depiction - amazing. A highlight of what is an impressive and epic film throughout  and a must see for any film fan worth their salt - I can't recommend this film highly enough  and plan to watch it again before the cinema run expires. In my opinion this is better than any STAR WARS movie or HARRY POTTER - and easily one of the best fantasy movies ever made  although it has to be said the competition isn't exactly stiff. Bring on the sequel!",positive

My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters  we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted  there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books  but this captures the charm  the wonder  the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake  not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was  I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.,positive

After a sole writing nomination for one of his earlier works  Jackson started his big run with the Academy Awards here back in 2002. The first hour was pretty great here. I thought the female narrator was a good introduction to the films and I also really enjoyed looking at all the juicy green from the Shire. And we should be glad the headless horseman did not manage to get little Frodo after 60 minutes as then the whole tale would have been over already. That Frodo seemed quite a survivalist anyway looking at the quantity of situations where he came out alive  almost like the Chosen One from ""The Matrix"". However  the actor who plays Agent Smith is one of the good ones here. They all seem to have a talent to stay away from death  even if they are getting in the most dangerous situations  like Gandalf falling deep down and becoming the White Gandalf. This applies also to many other characters who keep getting missed by Orc arrows by centimeters. Lucky bunch.Anyway  back to the story. This is obviously a fantasy drama  but it has its fair share of comedic moments as well. Most of these involve the two other Hobbits or pretty much every scene with Gimli the Dwarf  for example when he asks to not be pulled on his beard. While we're at it  that nasty creature down there in the dwarfs' graveyard is truly disgusting. Most of the film is about the journey though  the whole adventure when the group is still together. At the end  they split up. Frodo and Sam keep going to destroy the ring. Aragorn  Legolas and Gimli try to free the other two hobbits. I can't say the film did not drag a single second during its 3.5 hours runtime (for me it mostly did during the fight sequences)  but at least we get to watch beautiful landscapes and cinematography from start to finish. Also all the creatures included here are fairly special and memorable.One of my favorite scenes is when we see Frodo's grief and regret when Gandalf allegedly dies as Frodo was the one who wanted to take the Moria route and Gandalf did not. Another one I liked was the Elf marching scene early on when Sam says it makes him sad for some reason. It's almost like a special march of animals (penguins for example  or birds flying south). Two scenes I did not like that much were when we saw what the ring does to people. Bilbo and Galadriel look almost like horror movie creatures during their respective scenes and that is not a course the film takes at any other point. This film is all about Sauron's invisible danger and these two transformation scenes did not work in its favor. Nonetheless  Saruman felt more like the main antagonist in this film here  first of all of course because of his fight against Gandalf and then also because he pretty much commands the Orc army. During one scene he gives the order to kill all those who accompany the Hobbits. Then there is the usual components to this kind of movies  such as the enemy within the group  who (luckily to Frodo?) gets killed by the Orc army.Elijah Wood was one of the most promising young actors back then  so it was no surprise he got cast. The bigger surprise is possibly Sean Astin  who was not that well-known  but worked wonders during the whole trilogy and is possibly my favorite actor from the whole cast taking all three films together. Today he is possibly the epitome of the loyal friend in movie history. The movie ends with an Enya song (also Academy Award nominated). She did the super successful song connected with the 9/11-tragedy some months earlier and her song here works very well too. Taking all components together  this is a pretty good movie and a must-see for everybody with an interest in the fantasy genre.",positive

Frodo  a hobbit with a pure enough heart to resist the ring  is selected to make the journey to destroy the ring.The story here is very heavy and a good job has been made of trimming down the story to make it accessible to those not familiar with the story.  The characters are quite well developed - the beauty of the film is that it knows it will be a trilogy of films so it doesn't have to rush past characterisation where other films would need to get down to action quickly to ensure that it can get a sequel greenlighted.The visuals are fantastic  the special effects are brilliant and are mixed well with New Zealand's natural scenery to great effect  there's no doubting that Jackson can cope with such a grand canvas to work on.  The action scenes are also very well handled and the monster special effects are mostly good (only occasionally it is obvious that some are computer generated).The main problem with the film is that it isn't a lot of fun.  I know it wants to be serious but it also needs to be fun for the audience to watch  three hours is a long time to sit listening to lots of talk about family trees and ancient quests etc.  I didn't want comedy but it all took itself too seriously to be totally enjoyable.  Another problem with it is that the pacing is all off - the film has a set pattern that goes all the way through  first a talky scene with slow camera movements  then the music changes  the camera starts zooming around and we enter an action scene  then back to a talky scene  then an action/chase scene and so on.  It all gets a bit tiresome with it's continual cut between action/talking/action/talking with a relentless monotony.  There's nothing wrong with the content but it all gets a bit tiresome after a while.The cast are roundly great - almost totally well cast with the exception of Hugo Weaving who looks  sounds and acts just like his character in the Matrix - it makes it too distracting.  Wood as Frodo is a little too serious at times  gazing off into the distance and delivering straight dialogue. Bean and Mortensen are both great  Bean especially with his flawed character struggling against the ring.  The best character in the film is the ring! The film suffers from not having a bad guy to focus on (Christopher Lee is built up but he isn't the main source of evil).  Giving the ring itself the ability to tempt and manipulate and speak  this makes it the main evil character and makes the quest even more tense.Overall it's a big grown up blockbuster with amazing effects but it isn't very much fun to watch (not just laughs but basic enjoyment).  A good film but far from perfect - 4 out of 5.,positive

""Star Wars"" still hadn't come out yet  and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R. Tolkien  it was simply best left to the imagination.Well  imagination has found life in ""The Fellowship of the Ring""  a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy  just as the books did for the written word. Upon first seeing it during it's initial release  I couldn't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure. Everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind; it was as if Peter Jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on.I feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of Middle Earth  as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation. For example  when the Black Riders appear for the first time  it's difficult to grasp what they're all about  other than the fact that they're after the ring. Strider's explanation of the Nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men  neither alive nor dead  who always feel the power of the ring. Coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place.The real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other. Though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear  can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves  dwarfs  hobbits and wizards actually exist. Even orcs and evil Uruk hai have a place in this world  for without the danger they pose there is no triumph.If the movie captures your imagination and you haven't read the trilogy or it's prequel ""The Hobbit""  you'll be doing yourself a favor to do so. There in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as Elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of Middle Earth. It's a world easy to get lost in  and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land  people  and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone.",positive

The plot of course has several hobbits and humans joining up in Middle Earth to destroy a ring that corrupts whomever possesses it; in the process  they have to fight off evil beings. The movie is beyond impressive. In fact  there isn't any adjective that can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it. Peter Jackson adapted J.R.R. Tolkien's novel to the screen as a work of art that would otherwise be unfathomable. I've never read the novel  but I can say that Elijah Wood  Ian McKellen  Viggo Mortensen  Sean Astin  John Rhys-Davies  Liv Tyler  Cate Blanchett  Christopher Lee  and Ian Holm  interpret the characters with a style and quality that we usually associate only with history's most distinguished actors and actresses.

This is not a bad thing; just make sure you'll have enough time to watch all three films fairly close together. The film is very long but I don't think there were any scenes that could have been removed or trimmed so the length is justified.I think the film followed the book fairly well  although I confess it has been a while since I read it. After a short prologue where we are given a history of The Ring. We then find ourself in the Shire  the home of the Hobbits; the wizard Gandalf has come to attend a birthday party for his old friend Bilbo Baggins. During the party Bilbo announces that he is going to be leaving the Shire  he then slips a ring onto his finger and vanishes into thin air. When he takes the ring off again he is confronted by Gandalf who tells him he must leave the ring behind when he goes as it is dangerous.Unfortunately his use of the ring has been noticed by the evil Sauron who has dispatched nine wraiths; horsemen who's sole purpose is to retrieve the ring for their master. Gandalf instructs Bilbo's nephew Frodo to take the ring to Elves at Rivendell. On the way he and three Hobbit friends meet up with a mysterious man who helps them flee from the riders although Frodo is wounded and needs the Elves to recover. At Rivendell the group learn that their quest is not over  they must continue on to Sauron's land of Mordor where they can finally destroy the ring. The group are joined by Gandalf  an Elf called Legolas  Gimli the Dwarf and a man called Boromir.This film doesn't go as far as Mordor  in fact it only shows the first part of the journey which will see our heroes battling Orcs  other strange creatures and their own desire for the power the ring may bring; not all of the group will survive.As this is a fantasy film they are a lot of special effects  thankfully they are so well done that they don't look like effects even though we know they must be  I especially liked how they made the hobbits look so small  had I not seen the actors in other films it would have been almost possible to believe that the actors really were that short. Peter Jackson did a great job on this film getting a good performance from all his actors; a combination of well known veteran actors and young actors who will probably go onto be stars although I suspect this is the film they will be remembered for.,positive

To my surprise  it did not disappoint.Now  several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each  I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through  probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good  to be sure  but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey  but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire  before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway  ""Fellowship "" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes  one after the other  for three straight hours. Some are beyond description  and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view  both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain  too  from the lush Shire of the Hobbits  to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes  as in the two movies that followed  scenes radically change from calmness to action  adventure to romance  sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters  on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.",positive

Which is odd  because I have been playing Dungeons & Dragons since around the mid-1980s.Then I got my hands on the extended version in 2020  and decided to sit down and watch it again. Perhaps I have matured since 2001  because I found the movie to be much more enjoyable this time around  despite it running for close to four hours. Sure  it was a long ordeal  but enjoyable none the less.The characters are well-rounded and they have a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform the various roles in the movie. And I am still amazed with how the visual effects team managed to make the hobbits and dwarves small in size in comparison to the elves and humans. But it worked so nicely in favor of the movie and the fantasy atmosphere of Tolkien.This is definitely a story-driven movie  so it might not have appeal to everybody  especially those hungering for more action.The visual effects in the movie were great  and the Nazgul were impressive.If you haven't already seen ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring""  it is definitely a movie you should take the time to sit down and watch.My rating for this movie is a seven out of ten stars - or rings  if you will.",positive

Tolkein's fantasy classic: it's magical  imaginative and completely unforgettable  but also extremely long and a little hard going at times. Those who stay the distance  however  seem to agree that a bit of perseverance is well worth it in the end.The Fellowship of the Ring is perhaps the most laborious of the three films  what with the setting up of the plot  the introduction of a multitude of characters  and several talky scenes eating into the 171 minutes running time  but thankfully the film's impressive fantasy fighting action  breath-taking scenery  and amazing performances more than make up for the duller moments.All in all  I found The Fellowship of the Ring to be an admirable start for this ambitious attempt at bringing Tolkein's complex fantasy epic to the screen.,positive

Tolkien's fanciful-but-incredibly-detailed set-up for the story  but neither is it anything more than just a jumble of scenes (an expansive but darkly-lit battle  close-ups of faces  wind blowing the hair of warriors)  and once the actual plot got underway I had hope that this fractured fairy tale-style was just an aberration. The first hour is actually rather leisurely  with an introduction to the Hobbit village that is sweet if a little slow (and hampered by show-off fireworks effects). But once the first journey is undertaken by the Fellowship  frenetic action scenes  too many battles  and countless close-ups of THE RING in someone's palm take over. The direction is deadening  relying far too heavily on special effects and sound effects to juice the narrative. The acting is good except from the women (Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are poorly-used) and we get elaborate glimpses of magical worlds without ever gaining a sense of their histories. Blanchett rules the Forest of Women  and indeed it is eye-popping  but the scene is a bummer  only included so Blanchett could help forecast Elijah Wood's future (scenes from the next installment!). The movie is not a cheat: it packs in a lot of astounding action  but that's all it is  action for it's own sake. The art directors go for overkill in dazzling this thing up  but lovers of intriguing and substantial content will feel undernourished. The film gives you your money's worth  sure  but only in style. **1/2 from ****",negative

I never read ""The Hobbit"" nor any of the ""Ring"" trilogies. So I only had a vague idea what Tolkien and his writings were all about  although I already knew there were ""Ring"" fanatics of all ages out there. I got a ""free"" DVD as a result of the Blockbuster campaign where you buy a 10-week rental card for $25 and get a DVD in return at no extra cost. A deal I couldn't refuse!Well  last night I watched the film  along with good friends Frank and Judy who happen to be ""Ringheads."" The filming was absolutely gorgeous. The DVD transfer is about the best I have seen so far  and the Dolby 5.1 sound is very dynamic and beautiful. In short about all one could ask for in a DVD. Plus  there is a second disk which has over two hours of ""extras""  several ""making of"" plus a 10-minute preview of the second installment due out later this year. While the movie itself is very interesting  especially the first one-third which sets the stage for the journey that ""the fellowship of the ring"" will undertake  to ultimately return the ""one ring"" to the volcano  NEVER did I feel that this was a ""great"" film. As the story unfolds there are increasingly brutal battles to be fought  one after another  with little story between each battle. While that may make for really good reading  where you can create exactly the images you want in your own mind  as a film it gets to be a bit much. I actually became bored  with yet another battle and narrow escape. Like adding too much spice to a good meal.As a film of a historic work of fiction  and especially this DVD release  it is almost perfect.  However  as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down  in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the ""Ringheads"" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years  after I've seen all three of the installments.",positive

Only Gandolf knows why. This is a slim replacement  but done after some time has passed. That distance is valuable.The game here is one that you can only lose. Books can tap the imagination in ways that film ruins because what you see constrains what you can imagine. The books were successful because they created a whole world in such a way that found niches in our ability to envision. The best that can be done is to amaze visually  not trample the actual story  and hope that distracts from the fact that something unbounded is now visually bounded forever.My original comment spoke to small compromises made in the film that make the pagan notions fit more clearly in a Christian context. That's likely what prompted the removing complaint  so I avoid repeating the mistake. But I will note how the women  Ms Blanchett and Tyler are photographed. They are so idealized (even for film!) that I sat impressed. The camera can construct beauty and imply so much more. They do so here  and many girls will struggle with these ideals in the future.I think the idealization of Cate adds one dimension to the story that wasn't quite in the book: Cate's magical pledge could be seen as creating a vision that is the entire rest of the story. I prefer this  seeing all the monsters and motivations as coming from this lovely magical queen's mind. Cate as Elizabeth  the magical queen that Spencer has as the Fairie Queen whose dreams define the world. This way  the imagination part of the project is made explicit.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.,positive

I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER  HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity   I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second )   but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom   give us Nicole   get Harrison   get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans   this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book   people who have never read the book   enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS",positive

Instead  we move from set piece to set piece (grand  beautiful sets abetted by dazzling visual effects) and in between each new grand view locale there's another battle of good vs. evil with weapons clashing in every direction and limbs lopped off as fierce battles ensue.It's a sort of dungeons and dragons world and if this is your thing then this is your dark movie adventure. I saw this on video rather than the big screen so I can assure you it probably all looks a lot grander on the theater screen with the deafening stereo sound effects adding to the vigor of the story. But none of the characters really stand out amid all this swordplay and skullduggery.Only Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood have substantial enough parts to connect a viewer to the movie. The others are all backgrounders without becoming characters we care about--with the exception  perhaps  of Christopher Lee as Saruman the White  who always makes a convincing villain. Another problem is the sound--voices are dropped so often that much of the stilted dialogue is muted. This is a special drawback because several of the actors have some sort of accent. The worst offender happens to be Ian McKellen who nevertheless gives a very compelling performance behind his grizzly make-up--however  someone should have dubbed some of his lines for greater clarity. The likeable Elijah Wood relies on his specialty--wide-eyed wonder or tense concern for close-ups  but it's rather a one-note performance.All in all  I was disappointed. With all of the hype (and due to some of the comments expressed here) I expected a much more substantial story than this  especially for a movie with a running time of almost three hours. The drawback on video is that many of the special effects are pretty obvious and the big screen grandeur is lost even when viewed on a large TV screen.
A bit of a letdown in every department. Even the score only occasionally has the right mystical quality between battles. The battles are not quite as brutal as those in GLADIATOR but their intensity is just as great and they turn up with alarming frequency!",positive

Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on.  All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting  totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in  but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast  long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs  40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood  Dominic Monaghan  Cate Blanchett  Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).

That's because my daughter is nuts for comic book movies and we always seem to see them. Some I have loved (""Scott Pilgrim""  ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Captain America"" come to mind) and some I didn't (""Daredevil"")--but mostly I do enjoy them. While I am sure I am bucking the tide here  I was NOT especially thrilled with ""The Dark Knight Rises"". This doesn't mean I disliked it--it just left me a bit flat. Now the problem was NOT the movie's length--I like longer films and my butt didn't fall asleep during the film (which is a very good sign)! My problems were more about the incredibly dark tone of the film. Unlike ""The Dark Knight""  ""The Dark Knight Rises"" really lacked fun and was 100% devoid of any humor to break up the dark mood. In fact  I kept hoping Tony Stark (""Ironman"") would do a crossover from the Marvel films and lighten the mood! Stark (Robert Downey) managed to do a Bruce Wayne-like character but infuse him with energy and likability--Christian Bale just seemed tired and limp and humorless. This was more obvious in this film as opposed to the last because there was no Joker-like villain to provide comic relief (albeit darkly comic). The closest they got was Catwoman (Anne Hathaway)--who was a GREAT character but who wasn't really necessary for the plot. As for Bane and his friends  they were scary and nasty...and nothing more. When the film was over  I realized I had a reasonably good time but nothing more. If some other director and actor pick up the franchise  my advise is work more on the characters--make them more likable and interesting--even the villains.",positive

Is it perfect? For me  not quite  there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same  one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan  it is a visually audacious film  with gorgeous cinematography  a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me  but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact  and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites  this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here  as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved  Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence  Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane  a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice  but as Catwoman she is spot on  here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is)  she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all  a hugely impressive film  the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast  I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title  by the way)  though  blows it out of the water  offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.It's eight years since the last film  and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long  though  a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy  whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city  so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.As usual  Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre  making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film  instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes  at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other  and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clichés (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope  which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through  but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.The cast is thorough and involved as ever  Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in  and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type  but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn.,positive

THE DARK KNIGHT RISES isn't quite as good as the previous film but I'd put it a little ahead of the first movie in the series but no matter how you rank them you really have to give Nolan  Bale and company credit for really delivering a very special series that I'm sure went a lot higher than most people thought when news broke that this group would be taking over the franchise. While this film is far from perfect there are still so many great things that it's easy to get lost in the film and caught up in the various situations going on. I think the strongest thing going for the picture is the wonderful visual style and as with the previous two films  the way Nolan builds this dark atmosphere and city is just something so many other directors should be studying going forward. Another major asset is that Bale can bring that dark and mysterious nature to the Wayne character while at the same time being very believable in the part of Batman. I think it's fair to say that he's put his stamp on the character and if this is his last go at it then he's done more than any previous actor. The supporting cast includes strong work from Michael Caine  Morgan Freeman  Joseph Gordon-Levitt  Mario Cotillard and Gary Oldman. Hardy was extremely good in the villain role of Bane and really helped make the film so much fun. Anne Hathaway gives a decent performance as Catwoman but I must admit that I thought the screenplay really didn't do much for the character and in the end she had little impact with me. The 164-minute running time does seem a bit too drawn out at spots but I was still rather amazed at how well it flowed and this credit certainly goes to Nolan. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES closes this trilogy and really ends it with a bang and it's clear that the series going forward will have a lot to live up to.,positive

I know it's fashionable to hammer Anne Hathaway for her portrayal. But what do people expect from her exactly? Do they want her to puRRR constantly? Do they really expect her to camp it up? That would run contrary to Christopher Nolan's vision. No  she played it to the level of Nolan's vision. She's not camping it up. She's not playing it big. She injects fragility into the character that is very much in keeping with this iteration of Batman. She injects much needed humanity into this character.As for the movie  I have the same problem as the other 2. Too much explaining. That's why Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best.

True to form we watched this film in the Odeon with a good handful of people chatting all the way through it and of course one woman who refused to turn her phone off or even onto silent even after it had rung for the third time during the near-silent scene in which Batman flies the nuclear bomb away from Gotham (and the pre-film adverts suggest that it is piracy that is putting people off going to the multiplex). Anyway  despite all this i was still glad to have gone to the cinema to see this as visually it is very impressive and does deserve to be seen on the big screen due to its strength as an out and out spectacle because it does look as good as the previous films.Unfortunately in many ways DKR is the least of the three Nolan Batman films as it doesn't all deliver as it should. As before the film wears a heavy Gothic air to it that sets it far away from the more cartoony comic book movies and at the start of the film I quite liked that it did seem to take its time and let Wayne's physical and emotional seclusion breathe as a subject. However it is not long before there isn't the material to really support the very serious air and there are times where it feels a little superficial  like it is unable to not take itself so seriously. This gets harder as the film quickly gets to a point where it has very little time to do anything. Character development (beyond that which we already know) is gone  even motivations are skimmed and the story telling has very little room and ends up having plenty of convenience (such as characters finding each other without any logical way of being in the same place so easily) and also scenes without any bridge of any form (scene 1  Bruce Wayne climbs out of a prison somewhere in the world  scene 2  Bruce Wayne is in Gotham and bumps into Selina). None of these were major problems in themselves  but it made the film feel rushed and perhaps a little half done.As a story it was a little too simplistic and had too much going on; I understand the desire to link everything back to the other films but there are several characters I could have done without. Catwoman is poorly developed while the twist of the villainess at the end not only hurts Bane's standing but also seem unnecessary as an addition. Bane's mission offers much but doesn't have the menace or impact it should have and this also had an impact on him as a character. Bane is physically imposing and smart with it  but he doesn't have the menace that the Joker had in the previous film – OK  this is a comparison that I'm making  but it is hard not to make it while watching. The voice doesn't help as it is sometimes difficult to fully make out what was said  while also being a little comical because he sounds like The Elephant Man. Tom Hardy was the right man for the job though (those who saw him in Bronson know he can fearlessly do chaos and violent threat) but he isn't used as well as he could have been. The rest of the cast are mixed; Bale is good and his Batman voice is less of an issue. Gordon-Levitt helps with the action but his character is poor and he coasts on his own charisma (which is nearly enough). Hathaway is OK but again too superficial. Cotillard rounds out an Inception heavy cast. The smaller roles feature a lot of faces  which at times gets distracting whether it is larger smaller roles (Modine  Freeman) or the smallest ones (him from Dexter  them from The Wire etc).I have sounded negative here but I did enough DKR as a spectacle of noise and darkness – I liked what it was aiming at and I liked that it fitted into the trilogy thematically. However it is flawed; it has too much to do in too little time and would have been better doing a little less as it would have gotten more from its characters if it had fewer of them. DKR still delivers what the previous films had delivered  but just not as well. Still better than many garish comic book blockbusters  just not as good as the bar it set for itself.,positive

He is a seemingly impossible foe for ailing Batman who kept reminding me of Rocky V.Anne Hathaway makes for an interesting Catwoman who freely walks the line between good and evil. She is perhaps the most complex character in the story. The film has an incredible amount of action with important plot points happening nearly all the time. You don't want to go out for popcorn during the feature  you will be lost when you return. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Blake  a police officer/detective who grew up in an orphanage...do you see it coming?PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs  sex  or nudity.,positive

So this review will not have any comparisons with that ""world"". And I try to distinguish that from the start  because you have to accept (if you want to enjoy the movie) that Nolan did create something different from the components the Batman universe gave him to play with and made it work.Of course this other world does seem to be more grounded in reality (as much as is possible) and couldn't be compared to what normally is a comic book movie. That's either a good or a bad thing  depending on your view of things. Only thing I might not agree with entirely is Marion Cottilard. While I like her  I think someone else should have been in the movie instead of her. You might understand after you watch the movie.I really like the conclusion and while the previous movie (The Dark Knight) seems a bit better at this point of time  the third Nolan Batman movie has a lot to offer too. Of course the ""reboot"" is in the works already and we will get another Batman soon. Spiderman showed it does work and is successful too. Tom Hardy is not as charismatic as Heath Ledger  but he doesn't have to be. Hope you're watching it on a good sound system  because his voice could be a bit hard to understand if not.The number of IMAX scenes have been increased and the movie looks incredible. I also had the feeling that the fight scenes (while not the best choreographed)  look a lot better on the IMAX screen than on the regular one.Unfortunately the movie might be associated by some (even when time passes) with two things: The shooting in a theater during a screening (which led to another movie being delayed due to the fact it had a cinema shootout - Gangster Squad) and the Bane/Bain discussion  summing up some republicans and democrats using this movie as propaganda. Hopefully you'll see this as entertainment (as Nolan intended it to be) and like it too.",positive

""The Dark Knight Rises"" was certainly much heralded  coming as it did amid a blockbuster summer line-up that included ""The Avengers"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". But as good as it was  I couldn't help feeling that there was something missing in this third installment of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. Or conversely  maybe not something missing  but perhaps too much included in the way of excessive special effects and over the top CGI. Take the Bat-Plane for example  or whatever that thing was winging it's way over Gotham City. It just didn't look real enough to be convincing and there were times it looked comical in all too dangerous situations. Same goes for the Bat-Cycle  the laws of physics would have something to say about the way it transforms in mid-ride to transform it's wheel base and take off in an entirely different direction.As for the character of Bane  he would have been truly menacing in a Hannibal Lecter film  but I had some trouble with his characterization here as the leader of the Gotham underworld. Upon first introduction  Tom Hardy's villain didn't have any kind of physical stature to speak of  in fact I almost laughed in one scene where he seemed to have a bit of a paunch. I know I'm dating myself  but when Bane was introduced into DC Comics continuity back in 1993  the one person I thought could adequately portray him in a movie was the villain wrestler Van Vader  or Vader for short as he came to be known. Vader wore a masked hood that added to his fearsome appearance  and would have been perfect here  WITHOUT the goofy gas mask looking gimmick. How Bane could all of a sudden manhandle Batman in this picture seemed something of a stretch for me  but I do credit the film for it's handling of the 'Breaking of the Bat' story line from the comic books.The surprise of the picture for me was the handling of the Catwoman character portrayed by Anne Hathaway. Very sensuous  slinky and athletic at the same time  while adding an air of mystery to the Batman relationship. I'm still not sold on Christian Bale as Batman though. As Bruce Wayne I guess he's OK  but the story here didn't convince me that he came out of an eight year retirement  practically as an invalid  in order to take on the cape and cowl of the Caped Crusader. (Do the comics even use that term anymore?) It never seemed realistic to me that those couple of push-ups would have gotten Bruce Wayne in shape to take on anybody  even a human sized maniac like Bane.Now if I were interpreting the ending of the film all by myself  it would seem a fairly common sense conclusion that Batman sacrificed himself by ditching the nuclear weapon designed by Dr. Pavel over the ocean  well away from Gotham City proper. But then you had Alfred (Michael Caine) realizing his daydream fantasy by exchanging glances with Bruce Wayne in the company of Selina Kyle at an outdoor café in Paris. So did that really occur  or was it a clever trick to keep the viewer primed for a sequel (which I know won't happen with director Nolan). The IMDb Q&A board seems to answer the question definitively  but how am I supposed to figure it out from the movie? So all in all  that brings me back to my original thought. Even though I enjoyed the film well enough  it just seemed to beg for more in the way of compelling story telling and character development. There's also the effectiveness of the dialog. There was a good portion of what the characters were saying that I missed in the theater environment just because the voices didn't carry very well. Once it's out on DVD with captioning I'm sure I'll do a lot better with it  but I'd rather get the full experience right up front.",positive

But aside from that  the movie's plot still needs to get discussed.It was going to be all but impossible to top ""The Dark Knight"". While ""The Dark Knight Rises"" doesn't quite reach its predecessor  it comes pretty close. The movie takes place some years after the last one  and Bruce Wayne is now a recluse. Due to the lie that Batman and Commissioner Gordon had to promulgate in the last movie  the Caped Crusader has been totally out of the scene ever since. But then comes Bane...It's worth noting that the Bane in this movie has no relation to the butchered version in the execrable ""Batman & Robin"". This Bane  played by Tom Hardy  is pure evil but is a very clever  calculating individual. He's kind of like the Joker in the last movie  except that instead of creating terror for terror's sake  he's more comparable to Stalin.The other challenge for Batman is of course Catwoman. But this Catwoman  played by Anne Hathaway  is not really a villain as much as a kleptomaniac (or cat burglar  if you will) who exists as more of a challenge to Bane.And then there's the issue of why Bane does what he does. Bane says that he wants to liberate everyone. But look how many assumed revolutions have led to governments just as bad as those that they toppled. Is the movie's point that there is no fully legitimate government? Like I said  the movie isn't a masterpiece. The action scenes are really over-the-top. More than anything  I liked Anne Hathaway's performance as Catwoman. The movie is definitely worth seeing.",positive

Basically it's been eight years since the events of The Dark Knight  where Harvey Dent died  but the Dent Act is continuing  despite Commissioner James 'Jim' Gordon (Gary Oldman) hiding the secret of Dent murdering some people and Batman aka Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) taking the blame  but violent and organised crime is lowering. Gordon writes a confession letter to inform the people of the truth  but it doesn't seem the right time to read it  and it falls into the hands of masked terrorist Bane (Bronson's Tom Hardy)  police officer John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) takes Gordon to hospital to recover from a gunshot. Batman has disappeared for eight years  and Wayne is a recluse  and as a result of this  and investing in the clean energy project from board member Miranda Tate (La Vie en Rose's Marion Cotillard)  Wayne Enterprises is near bankrupt  it was discovered that the fusion powered harness could be modified and the core could become a nuclear weapon. Blake concludes that Bruce is Batman  he and Gordon implore the caped crusader to return to Gotham City  but Bruce is forced to relinquish his family's company when Bane attacks the stock exchange and bankrupts him  control goes to rival businessman John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn)  but he is killed by Bane and he gets his construction empire. Faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth (Sir Michael Caine) confesses to Bruce he burned the letter Rachel wrote before she was killed  about being engaged to Dent  and he says the seven years he was gone  in Batman Begins  he hoped he would never return  and Alfred leaves him. It's revealed to Batman that Bane took over the League of Shadows  after Ra's Al Ghul (Liam Neeson) died  and he is lead to him by cat burglar Selina Kyle aka Catwoman (Anne Hathaway)  but the masked mastermind beats Batman very harshly  fracturing his back  and he goes to the impossible to escape foreign prison. Bane as a child is believed to be the only person to have escaped the prison  he has almost completely taken over Gotham  trapping all police underground  using stolen weapons from Wayne Enterprises  and collapsing all routes out of the city  anyone seen escaping may set off the converted nuclear bomb the terrorist has his hands on. To make matters worse  the letter that Gordon wrote is read out for all of the citizens to hear  proving corruption comes not just from criminals  all prisoners arrested under the Dent Act are released and free to roam the city  and rich and powerful individuals are put to trial by ""judge"" Dr. Jonathan Crane aka Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) to face exile or death. Five months pass  and Bruce is recovering from his injuries and ready to return to the city  and after a couple of failed attempts and his back strengthened he is successful jumping the impossible feat  without safety stuff  and he recruits Selina  Gordon  Blake  Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Tate to help save the city from the bomb. Batman battles his way to get to Bane and manages to fight and seemingly defeat him  but then Tate shows up and reveals that it was not Bane that escaped the foreign prison  it was her  she is actually Talia  the daughter of Ra's Al Ghul  and with her father they rescued Bane who helped her out  so she is the one who plans revenge for her father's death and achieve his goal of destroying Gotham City. While Selina kills Bane  and Gordon manages to destroy the detonator to the bomb  Batman tries to direct the container truck towards the location of the fusion chamber where the weapon can be stabilised  but the chamber is flooded  and she crashes the truck  and before dying taunts the Dark Knight that the bomb will still explode. Batman decides that the only way to save the city is to sacrifice himself  by hauling the bomb out of city limits flying it away with the aircraft developed by Fox  and it does explode over the ocean  seemingly killing the hero. With Gotham saved Batman is no longer seen as a threat  he is praised as the hero who saved everyone  getting a monument statue  and Bruce is assumed dead after being in the riots  Gordon reminds Blake that he should not reveal Batman's identity to the world to let hope stand  and the bat-signal is repaired. The Wayne estate is left to the orphanage that Blake grew up in  and the rest of the fortune and so forth goes to Alfred  who is devastated that he let Bruce's parents down  but Fox discovers that the aircraft was put on autopilot months ago  and Alfred is happy in Italy to see Selina and Bruce alive  and Blake – real name revealed as Robin  enters the Batcave. Also starring Matthew Modine as Foley  Atonement's Juno Temple as Jen  Nestor Carbonell as Mayor Anthony Garcia  Burn Gorman as Stryver  Tom Conti as Prisoner  Tomas Arana as Wayne's Lawyer  Aidan Gillen as CIA Op  Desmond Harrington as Uniform and William Devane as President. Bale  who won his Oscar for The Fighter earlier in the year  is still a great choice being rough and ready  Hardy (with a dubbed deep voice) is really malicious and beefed up  Hathaway is surprisingly good as a sexy no-nonsense thief  and all the supporting cast members do well also. This instalment is certainly the biggest in terms of destruction from the villain  the special effects create some spectacular scenes of the city collapsing and during chases and fights  this is well paced and exciting to watch  and a good story to go with it  a fantastic action fantasy.

Then one day cat burglar Selina Kyle breaks into Wayne mansion and as well as stealing his mother's pearls she takes a copy of Bruce's fingerprints. She gives these to an accomplice of masked criminal  Bane  an expelled member of the League of Shadows. Bane then launches an attack on the Stock Exchange where he uses Bruce's fingerprints to authorise the transfer of all of his wealth thus bankrupting him. He manages to find Bane but is defeated and left  severely injured in an apparently inescapable prison. It is only then that we learn Bane's ultimate plan; he seizes the core from a nuclear fusion reactor that Wayne Enterprises had developed and  after setting off explosives that cut Gotham off from the rest of the county  announces that he will detonate the device and kill everybody if anybody tries to leave. And so begins his reign of terror. The months pass and Bruce struggles back to health and manages to escape and return to Gotham; he is now up against the clock as it emerges that the bomb is unstable and will soon detonate whether triggered or not.This film provides a fine conclusion to this trilogy. Bane is a suitable bad villain for this finale and his schemes were the most dastardly yet. He is definitely a human villain not a cartoonish super-villain. He has a good back story although  thanks to a late twist  some of what we are lead to believe isn't quite true. Then there is the fact that this is more a Bruce Wayne film than a Batman film; first he must overcome the death Rachel Dawes which kept him a recluse for eight years then after he finally becomes Batman again and is beaten by Bane he must heal physically and mentally before he can escape. We also have new characters Selina Kyle  an ambiguous thief who may ultimately prove to be a hero or a villain and policeman John Blake who rises from a young uniformed officer to help lead the fightback while Batman was not there. The cast does a fine job; notably returning cast members Christian Bale  Michael Caine and Gary Oldman. New cast members also impress; Tom Hardy is imposing as Bale; one can believe that he could beat Batman in a fight  Anne Hathaway is likable as Selina and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is good as Blake; the closest thing to an ordinary everyman of the film's main characters. There is plenty of spectacular action from an attention grabbing opening scene  through a series of chases and fights to an explosive conclusion. The end nicely wraps up the trilogy while still leaving things open for us to imagine what might happen next. Overall I'm sure fans of the series will enjoy this; I'd certainly recommend the first two films first though.,positive

Everything here just screams ""Batman"" comic book  and it is indeed the way it should be told.I am not going to go into details with the storyline  as it would be a waste of time and effort  as this movie is to be seen to be fully appreciated.Character-wise  then I think ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was really great. There was a lot of good character development and building here  both hero and villain alike. Personally  I didn't care much for the mask that Bane was wearing  and would have preferred something as in the actual comic books. But hey  creative output on the director's side  I suppose. Bane was indeed a good character and well fleshed out. Aside from his voice  with really was a moment of irritation.It was also nice to have Seliana/Catwoman back in the universe again  after some questionable appearances in the previous two movies where the Catwoman character was in. Costume-wise  then the costume designer could have come up with something more in the spirit of the Catwoman comic books  but hey  that is just a personal preference.The story progressed nicely and there was a brisk pace to it  which never lead to any dull moments. And there was actually a rather nice twist to the movie towards the last quarter of the movie. I really enjoyed that plot twist and hadn't seen that coming at all.And also the introduction to the Robin character was interesting  and far better than the previous movie where he was in. And I do believe that this actor  without revealing who it is for the sake of those who haven't seen the movie yet  will be doing a much better job with the character than Chris O'Donnell did.Again  the cast of actors and actresses was really great  as in the previous Christopher Nolan ""Batman"" movies. Lots of really talented people in the movie  and everyone was doing great jobs with their given roles and characters.The gadgets and toys were there  as always. However  the aircraft that Batman had in this movie was a little bit too futuristic and Sci-Fi for my liking.The action and fighting sequences were great and nicely choreographed. Lots of adrenaline and explosions here to help the story along for those adrenaline junkies in the audience.""The Dark Knight Rises"" was primarily driven by a great story and some interesting and good character development  and as such  then ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is definitely a movie well worth watching.",positive

It is made very well  with a good story  but it contains quite a bit of violence  with characters like Bane who just want to destroy a city. We know just a few months ago a young man entered a theater in Colorado at an opening night showing of this movie  and opened fire killing several theater-goers. We have no hard evidence that violence in games and movies influence nut-jobs to kill like this  but it has to make you wonder.So it was with that in mind that I watched this movie. (My wife chose not to watch it.) And I was somewhat surprised that it was better than I thought it would be. Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne and Batman has been in seclusion for about 8 years  still injured and using a cane to help with his walking. Gotham City seems calm and safe.However Tom Hardy as Bane  with an unusual mask that is always across his head and face  muffling his speech  ostensibly mitigating the pain from a former procedure  vowing to restore order for the poor and downtrodden  to put the wealthy and powerful in their place. With the help of a cat-like woman gets what he needs to steal a device from Wayne Enterprises  a new device that can be re-configured to turn into a fusion bomb  with the ability to destroy Gotham.Rusty  Batman is no match for Bane  who is of the League of Shadows  and Batman ends up in a terrible prison from which there is almost no hope for escape. But escape he must  for he and his contraptions are the only hope to defeat Bane.Anne Hathaway is Selina  the cat-like thief and expert fighter. She has been in and out of trouble and prison since she was 16  but now Batman must trust her to help the cause.I abhor the violence and terrorism  but overall a pretty good movie.MAJOR SPOILERS: Bruce Wayne does manage to get out of the prison and back to his former fighting skills. With the help of a flying contraption manages to snag the bomb and fly it out to sea where it exploded harmlessly. Before that Selina with the Bat motorcycle managed to blast Bane to smithereens. Presumed dead also a funeral was held for Bruce Wayne  but Joseph Gordon-Levitt as officer Robin Blake is given a note with GPS coordinates which leads him to the Bat Cave  entering he finds Wayne.

This one takes place eight years after The Dark Knight. Both the Caped Crusader and Bruce Wayne have been inactive during that time-enough time for a new terrorist named Bane (Thomas Hardy) to threaten Gotham City. There's also a jewel thief named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) who may or not eventually be persuaded to join Batman when the eventual battle begins...This one takes its time in getting to the exciting conclusion but when it does  it's very worthy of a series finale! New characters played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard are also worthy not to mention the additional return of Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox  Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth  and Gary Oldman as Commissioner James W. Gordon. There were also some other returning players that were a pleasant surprise to me but I won't reveal them here. Anyway  on that note  I very highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises. P.S. My heart goes out to all those 12 killed and 58 injured as the result of one man's massacre in that Aurora  Colo.  theatre during the premiere midnight screening there.

For example  the ending twist makes no sense to me. Why would Miranda Tate require the help of Bane to destroy Gotham City  when she is in control of the device already? ""The Dark Knight Rises"" may be an entertaining film  but I could not get into the story. It is far too confusing as it tries to play the ""Infernal Affairs"" game  where good guys are bad but bad guys are good. It contains elements of the first Batman movie from years ago which people would have forgotten about already.

A ruthless terrorist leader named Bane(Tom Hardy)has put together a dastardly plan to rip a decaying Gotham apart  as well as destroy Batman's legacy. Mild mannered and aging Bruce Wayne must summon what is left of his spirit and rebuild his physical skills to not only defend himself  but once again come to Gotham City's rescue.

There is a lot of story to cram in  and a few necessary inflection points to destabilize us. They impress  and this merger of story  image and Zimmernoise works well. But you already know that. As I post this  a mere few days after opening  the film is in the IMDb top ten of all time!This comment is about a simple dynamic: condensation. the love story that leaves us satisfied doesn't happen on screen. It is all in our minds  teased out by an amazingly economical shorthand. a similar love story on the villain side that has agency in the plot — that literally changes much of what we assumed for two hours  is also sketched with a very few  high power strokes. a terrific device involving the otherwise talkity butler. Early  we get a story about when Bruce was away; Albert visited a Florence cafe once a year for one short drink on the off chance he would see Bruce thriving (with no plans to return). This story came complete with images of one such disappointing visit. At our very end after all the normal reveals  he makes the trip again. The stare we get from Albert is a fold that resets our memory of everything we have seen. All the action and noise is put in our past as it has been in his. often in these plot-heavy films  the bad guy doublecross is either heavyhanded or needlessly complex. Here it is simple and again uses a shorthand that depends on our film memories  we have a lot of exposition about the history of an elite group of mercenaries and their prison. This takes an amazing percentage of the film  almost equal to the capture and holding of the ersatz Manhattan. As overwrought as all that is  the deep test of soul — the test that transforms — is reduced to one act: jumping from one ledge to another. unlike any other comic-based superhero film  the bad guy here has the most minimal costume; a mask and even that is explained as necessary in a Darth Vader sense. We've all been to so many summer films with illogically costumed villains that this registers.This and other notable dynamics tells me that Nolan and company understand the power of understatement in a sea of excess. Less matters when more surrounds it. An example of the excess is all the business about Robin's orphanage — down to the kindly but dumb Irish priest.I do think this is worth watching; the Dickensian influence is noticeable and welcome  especially after the hodgepodge story of the last episode. Still  there were two elements of the story that made me step out of my role as engaged watcher.One was an elaborate raid on the stock exchange  where a terminal is hijacked using Bruce Wayne's fingerprint. Many people die and the place is wrecked. Here is the story logic: Though everyone in the world would know of the raid and the use of that terminal by the crooks  no one would question the validity of trades made in Bruce's name. The loss of Wayne's money would result in him being removed from the board. Wayne's departure would automatically result in a schemer's succession  and that would somehow 'give control' of the corporation. This control would somehow extend to the closed fusion reactor project.Nothing in this computes. Hey  I'll buy the stadium bit  and the bomb  and the citizen trials because they all make sense in the storyworld. Not this.The second thing that got me... and this is because I know too much. In 'Iron Man ' it worked to have Tony Stark be a supergenius inventor  whose company also secretly made cool gear even with the perky secretary in charge. It makes no sense to me to have a company run by an avuncular caretaker make military weapons and for those to be sequestered as they are here.Military systems in general aren't really that sophisticated. All prototypes break. Everyone who pays attention knows about them. They take scads of people to develop. They take 15 years to design. If Wayne had that kind of money (modestly say $800B)  other things would be vastly different.The Marvel universe works better so far as the gear.Hathaway here is what Uma Thurman tried to be some time back.,positive

Miss Cotillard has whole sentences that are key to an understanding of her character that are barely intelligible. Surely  whoever designed the audio mix has some explaining to do.Otherwise  fans will get their money's worth of action and thrills despite a lumbering plot that takes far too long to unwind after a breathtaking opening shot involving mid-air hostages.And the performances are uniformly fine from the large cast--Christian Bale  Tom Hardy  Anne Hathaway  Matthew Modine  Joseph Gordon-Levitt  Gary Oldman and Michael Caine. But the flaws are there in the script which has too many strands of sub-plots to cover and too many humiliating fights between Bane and Batman before the man of steel redeems himself again.Nevertheless  there are moments where it kicks into high gear between some dull stretches. Christopher Nolan sees to it that the action sequences are given top priority to any other values inherent in the script.Personally  I still prefer the first and second ""Batman"" films to this one which is sometimes too muddled in content. Biggest drawback is the fact that the sound mix of voices vs. explosions (and Hans Zimmer's music) has been poorly handled at key moments in plot development.Fans of ""Batman"" will probably overlook these weaknesses in the long run  but I felt they should be pointed out.",positive

I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes  props  chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And  with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood  it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.If you look at my summary  however  I say that the film is a bit disappointing as well. As a retired history teacher  I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame  as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition  at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often  folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And  it turns out I am not alone. After the film  I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion  not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus  for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put  the human side to the film is stilted.So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still  it's well worth seeing.",positive

All of them  including the unjustly-maligned Legend  are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done  if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic  making some scenes upsetting to watch  but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant  especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role  and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant  as well as the sets. In conclusion  Gladiator is a near masterpiece  only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.,positive

his problems succeeding his legendary father  Emperor/philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Neither film got the story right  both have him killing his father and
both have him with a hero/rival. In the Mann film it's Stephen Boyd in this film it is Russell Crowe. Both have a sister working against him Sophia Loren in the
Mann film and in the Ridley Scott film Connie Nielsen.Although I loved Christopher Plummer in The Fall Of The Roman Empire  truth be told Joaquin Phoenix is closer to the real Commodus. Commodus was only a teen when he became Emperor in 180 AD and reigned a lot longer than it seemed in Gladiator. In real life he was strangled by a wrestler who was part of a conspiracy. He did in fact love the Coliseum and did like to participate occasionally as is shown in both films.In this film when Joaquin Phoenix learns that Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius plans to name Russell Crowe one of his best fighting generals as his successor he kills Harris and Crowe's family. Crowe is sold off in bondage  but works his way back to Rome to take Phoenix down.Gladiator marks he farewell film of Oliver Reed who plays the head of the gladiator school who trains Crowe. Derek Jacobi plays a senator and as he did
in I Claudius dreams of reestablishing the republic.Gladiator won for Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe and also won for costume design  special effects  and best sound. Sharp film fans will see
bits of both Ben-Hur and Spartacus woven into the story.Gladiator is a well put together drama and Crowe and Phoenix have quite an acting duel. Maybe the real Commodus story will get a film one day. Until then Gladiator and The Fall Of The Roman Empire will do nicely.",negative

Forget any of the other CGI-laden rubbish filling out the multiplexes  this is a film which simply has to be seen at the cinema - or alternatively on a very big television screen indeed. Due to the fact that this film was hyped up incredibly  it doesn't actually live up to the hype  but nothing could have done. GLADIATOR is pure  old-fashioned escapism  nothing less.For once  the acting is totally flawless. Russell Crowe comes out of nowhere to give us a powerful  sensitive action hero  able to emote without the use of dialogue  delivering his lines when needed with a gruff British accent. Crowe is a revelation here - I hated him in VIRTUOSITY  but his acting is excellent and finely judged  right up there with the brooding intensity of De Niro or Pacino. He is well supported by a varied cast  including Connie Nielsen who makes a very sultry and alluring love interest. Joaquin Phoenix makes his snivelling  whining emperor truly despicable  easily soaking up the entire audience's hatred. Oliver Reed is also very good in what was to be his final role  as the proud but friendly slave owner who becomes Maximus' friend. Richard Harris lends an air of nobility and authenticity in his brief role as the dying emperor Caesar  while noted British actors Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings appear as senators.Okay  so the plot of revenge is a fairly clichéd one and the plot here is reminiscent of a whole number of other films  as well as MACBETH  but it is given added power and resonance by the great acting. The music score is also absolutely excellent and really adds to this film's atmosphere. Physically  it is beautifully made and extremely realistic - you constantly feel that you're in Rome itself. Everything is epic and the whole film is chock-full of grandeur. It looks lovely  it sounds lovely  hell  it is lovely.Director Ridley Scott doesn't skimp on the gore front either  leaving in some gruesome shots of people being cut in half  being decapitated and blood spraying in the air and all over the place. The battle scenes are the highlight of the film and are filmed in a weird way - sometimes sped up  sometimes slowed down - which make them so realistic that you do feel like you're there. They're also very exciting  with Crowe taking on ferocious tigers  masked hulking warriors  and chariots too. The twists and turns in the plot are unexpected and there's a moving  poignant ending giving this film an extra element. Old-fashioned  well-crafted and truly splendid - any movie fan owes it to themselves to see this film.,positive

I'm sure it's a marvelous spectacle on the big screen. I don't know what it was. I found the acting good  the spectacle and special effects outstanding  the hero one we could cheer for. Why  then  do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype  best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot  I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler  leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is  but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up  you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year. We've come to demand a movie that looks good rather than one that grasps our heart.,positive

He is favoured to the point that the Emperor  sensing his death is near  commands him to succeed him and return Rome to a republic.  Caesar's son discovers this  kills his father and orders Maximus dead.  However he survives and  finding his wife and son murdered  is captured by slave merchants and sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.  As his skills increase his strength he eventually comes to the games at Rome  where he finds himself anonymous and within striking distance of the revenge he seeks.If you strip away all the period settings and political battling in the background  this film is essentially a revenge film and a good one at that. It's best to ignore the liberties it takes with both logic and history and enjoy it for what it is.  At times it does threaten to take itself too seriously  but it's worthy sheen is just about supported by the emotive story and strong characters.  The film hits a good mix of political goings-on and action  with the action being the main body of the film.  It is delivered in bloody spades and the action scenes are a lot more dramatic than I expected.Although the characters fit into traditional revenge movie moulds (wronged man  evil man in position of power etc) they still manage to be strong characters in their own right.  Maximus is a strong hero and it is hard not to feel for him and thus get involved in the film.  True  the script is very generous in it's painting of him but this is a minor issue.  Crowe takes the lead really well and  while I don't personally care for him  he really fitted the role here.  Phoenix plays it well despite the fat he could easily have given into mugging the evil role.  Harris is good in his small role  although Jacobi just shows up once or twice.  Reed has a good part for his swansong but this is really Crowe's film and he commands it as his character does his army.The close of the film always gets me as it treats the characters and audience with respect (although it is not as daring as some would suggest. Overall this is a great film to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously or go looking for flaws.  The music and direction gives it a great feel  the music in particular used to support the required emotions created by the action.  Three hours go by very quickly and enjoyably.,positive

For once  many things that happened were so foreseeable  I was able to close my eyes  open them a few minutes later and could see what I predicted was gonna happen.While that still works for many movies  it did kind of ruin my enjoyment of the Gladiator. A movie which ""resurrected"" the Sandal movie  as was stated back then. Obviously  ten years later it's safe to say  that didn't really happen. But what made this movie so popular? For one thing  every movie that has a sort of underdog as a main character  can always be sure to get many sympathies. But that's not all! Mr. Ridley Scott shot this movie in a great way. Some symbolisms in the framing and the color scheme  being also responsible for peoples reactions.And while I did like the fight scenes and the scenery in general  the movie left me cold for the main character. I'm not completely alone with my perception of the movie (I still think that a 6/10 is pretty good)  but it's more likely that you will like this and won't really think about plot points and the journey of the hero  while you watch this ... Something I couldn't do.Edit: No I watched the longer cut (wrongly called it Director's cut above as Mr. Scott would scold me for saying that earlier - it is just an extended cut) - and unlike Ridley  I actually liked the longer cut better. It added some gravitas and much needed backstory to certain things. And while the movie overall still remains predictable  the scope of it all is plain amazing. Considering the movie started while the script wasn't completely done  might even give this more things to like ... So I reckon I was maybe a bit too harsh on my initial rating (almost everyone I did watch it with fell asleep though)  but the rating now is for the rewatch.I still think that other movies (be it the old Spartacus or the newer TV show Spartacus to name a few) did it better ... but considering my love for Sandal movies as a kid  I should have seen the love that was put into this. No matter how easy to decipher and the cliches that were put in. And the fun Russell Crowe had on set .. the behind the scenes pranks  might give you a new view and love for this as well I reckon.",positive

It was quite a contrast then to see him once again in this film made a dozen years earlier. In fact  considering that Crowe was playing a Roman warrior  he actually looked like he might have been too small for the part. Well  so much for that.""Gladiator"" has an epic sweep not often seen in modern films  the opening battle scene makes you wonder if wars were actually fought that way in ancient times. The political intrigue involved in the plot to murder Maximus (Crowe) and it's failure sets up a dynamic story in which Maximus battles to regain respect and notoriety with the Roman citizenry. Personal relationships are put to the test as Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) proves to be a too cunning adversary to be defeated by normal means.You know  I had to replay the Commdodus/Maximus dungeon scene when Commodus stabbed his enemy  and it didn't make sense to me. When the blade struck Maximus  it appeared to go through his tunic which became blood stained  but in the pull away shot  Crowe wasn't wearing a garment of the same dimensions and he didn't appear to be injured or bleeding. I went back and forth with that one until I decided it had to be an error in filming or editing  but it certainly was a head scratcher.Anyway  this is an intriguing movie as long as you don't let historical accuracy guide you. Or get distracted by the use of elevators to raise soldiers up to ground level of the Coliseum to do battle. What's inspirational is the way Maximus earned the loyalty of his fellow warrior prisoners and their dedication to fight in strength and honor under impossible circumstances.",positive

Russell Crowe certainly did a good job as Maximus  and Joaquin Phoenix made a nasty Commodus. Although that was sort of the problem: the good guy was 100% good and the bad guy was 100% bad. It might have been a little better if there had been some gray area.But other than that  it was a really good movie.

Aurelius's designated successor  General Maximus (Russel Crowe) is betrayed  becomes a slave  a gladiator  finally a the most popular gladiator in Rome  and kills Commodus before he himself drops dead of an unfair wound. Rome is turned over to Senator Grachus and is saved. Commodus's sister (Connie Nielson) has a son who will become the next emperor. Actually  that happy return to a Republic is tacked on  isn't it? Dictatorships continued till the end.I kept trying to figure out just what elements distinguished ""Gladiator"" from the earlier sun and sandal epics of the 1950s  like ""Herculus "" usually starring some beefed-up parody of a male figure like Steve Reeves  or ""Ben Hur"" for that matter.Obviously ""Gladiator"" is more expensive and the special effects more especially effective. And  thank God  unlike Steve Reeves' epics the movie isn't dubbed  so nobody sounds like Orson Welles gargling.""Gladiator"" is darker all around than almost all earlier movies of the period. Cinecitta was always so sunny and its weather so balmy. There's a moment near the beginning of ""Ben Hur"" when Judah and Massala meet and Massala removes his decorative metal cuirass and reveals the soft scarlet cloth beneath it. It's a neat splash of color. There's nothing like that in ""Gladiator."" The Romans all wear dark clothing  usually black. And their armor is spiky-looking and abrasive  as if influenced by some video game or by Dungeons and Dragons. I guess the Senate wears white but even their robes are drained of brightness  so that they resemble the sheets that my laundry dryer produces. And sometimes it's cold too. Snow falls and the Romans wear fur robes. Pretty ugly stuff.The dialog isn't dubbed but the Foley artists have been hard at work generating the expectable clichés. No sword can be drawn without the slick sound of sharp metal against metal. And God forbid that a sword be thrown through the air without going whoo-whoo-whoo. If one of these behemoths swings his weapon it's invariably accompanied by a swoosh or a wheeesh. I don't know why. It doesn't make the motion more compelling in any way. It's a distraction because somewhere in the viewer's mind there must be the realization that if you swing a piece of metal through the air  it simply does not swoosh. The sounds of battle aren't the only clichés. The ""thumbs down/ thumbs up"" business for death and life was  I think  borrowed from an improvisation in a Cecil B. DeMille movie  not from the historical record.Award for best performance: Richard Harris (his last movie) as Marcus Aurelius  the emperor who is at least as well known for his philosophy -- he was a stoic -- as for his martial exploits. Imagine -- a head of state who can have an original thought? ""Death smiles at all of us and all we can do is smile back."" Award for best-looking and most succulent actress: Connie Nielson. She couldn't be better. I don't know about her performance but she looks absolutely right for the part of the bitter widow  abused by her own brother  hopelessly in love with a man she'll never have. She's beautiful  sensuous  elegant  and as cold as polished steel.Best imitation of Steve Reeves: Russel Crowe  he of the enormous trapezii. I wouldn't want to get in the arena with that guy. His performance? Well -- he tries to laugh at one point.Best bad guy: Joaquin Phoenix isn't bad as the evil  cowardly  deceitful Commodus. It wouldn't surprise me to find that he had an amphora stuffed with ladies' lingerie. I'll give him a pass on insisting on incest  inasmuch as Connie Nielson is the victimized party. But  man  what a creep; no longer the teen age beauty  slightly more plump  and with a thicker voice.Is it worth seeing? Well  of course! Could anything on which so much expense had been lavished NOT be worth seeing? And it's thought provoking too. The thought it provokes is: what is it in human nature that prompts us to watch innocent others suffer and die violently? No? You don't have to look long on the internet to find video clips with titles like ""Iraqi gets blown up "" or ""Marine has arm shot off!"" We can smugly dismiss ""the mob"" of Romans for their barbaric tastes but we can't pass a highway accident without looking for some mangled limbs. Hell  we revel in it.",positive

This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did  such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent  beginning with Russell Crowe  who has established himself as one of the best actors of today.

Ailing Marcus Aurelius ( Richard Harris) would like his confident and favorite to take over empire   but the events go wrong .

Maximus   then comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge .He won't swear loyalty and gets a chance to redeem himself .Father of a murdered son   husband to a murdered wife and I shall have my revenge in this life or the next .This bloody good movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality   thrills  fundamental emotions   fortright spectacle  fierce combats including scud catapults   and is pretty entertaining . The film results to be a special remake to ¨Fall of Roman Empire¨ directed by Antony Mann with Stephen Boyd   Sofia Loren and Christopher Plummer as Commodus   though is a little revisionist about characters   history and time when is developed the action . Before directing ¨Robin Hood   Kingdom of heaven¨ films   director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes . Great performances abound   as stalwart Russell Crowe playing an enslaved ex-general who bent on vengeance   he is very fine ; in addition   vacilating empress Connie Nielsen is memorable and attractive   she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate woman . Special mention to gladiator owner magnetically performed by Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix as evil and crazed emperor in a sensationalistic interpretation . Marvelous relationship between Maximus-Russel Crowe and an African slave-Dijimon Honsou   the deep bond lends a P.C. historicity. Ample support cast formed by notorious British secondaries as David Hemmings David Schofield   John Schrapnel and endearing Derek Jacobi . There are great action sequences including the battle against Barbarians and the final confrontation in arena at the climax of the film. Impeccable but sometimes dark cinematography by John Mathieson . Movie is shot on natural sets and interior scenarios with impressive production design by Arthur Max   but also excessive use of computer generator images . Magnificent and sensible musical score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard   including wonderful songs .I found it fun   well-acted   in Peplum tradition and fast-paced.The motion picture packed with pomp and pageantry is lavishly produced by the prestigious Douglas Wick and David Franzoni   also screenwriter ; being glamorously directed by Ridley Scott   at his best and as stylish as ever   similarly his previous film ¨Someone to watch over me¨ and others as ¨Blade runner¨  ¨Black rain¨   ¨Legend¨ in which his visual style is impressive . The picture belongs to his speciality  the historical genre   as ¨Robin Hood¨   ¨Kingdom of heaven¨   ¨Duelists¨ and ¨Black Hawk down¨ . Rating : Above average .

Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus  not one to give up quietly  makes a daring escape  and  badly wounded  heads for home  where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury  Maximus is captured by slavers  nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome  where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.From director Ridley Scott  Gladiator is a historical epic to rival the classics from the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Opening in 180 A.D.  with a brilliantly orchestrated battle between the Roman armies and the tribes of Germania  Scott's film grabs the viewer's full attention from the outset and doesn't let go until the end  having delivered an Oscar-winning central performance from Crowe  a memorable score by Hans Zimmer  excellent supporting roles from the likes of Harris  Phoenix  Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed  and some of the most impressively bloody scenes of hand to hand combat ever filmed.If I were to choose my favourite scene  it would be the 're-enactment' of the battle of Carthage  a savage piece of action cinema in which Maximus and his fellow gladiators are ushered into the arena like cattle to the slaughter  only to turn the tables on their attackers  winning the hearts of the Roman masses in the process. A rousing  blood drenched spectacle  it's a fine example of Scott's expert direction  a masterclass in camera placement and movement  editing (the violence is extreme  but the film doesn't wallow in the gore)  sound design and special effects  which still thrills even after all of these years.,positive

Still  it is a very entertaining film that plays shorter than its 2 1/2 hours  and gives a good glimpse of the Roman state of emperors and politics in the second century after Christ. I rate it a solid ""8"" of 10.The straightforward storyline is not new. A loyal soldier  a ""Spaniard"" (Russell Crowe)who aging emperor Marcus Aurelius calls ""Rome's greatest general""  leads the Roman army to a convincing victory in Germania  the last frontier for the 180 A.D. Romans. This general  ""Maximus""  is the son the emperor wishes he had and asks him to come to Rome to help create a democracy. Immediately all fortunes change and Maximus goes from general to slave to gladiator to rebel. Packed around that storyline are some excellent  however gory  battle and arena scenes. The film ends a bit unbelievably.The DVD picture and sound are great. You get 2 discs for your purchase  the second has all the ""extras"" which are quite extensive and provide good perspectives on the Roman Empire  and the making of this film.** CAUTION - SPOILERS - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK -----After the victory at Germania  all Maximus wants to do is go home to his farm and wife and young son. It had been 2 years and 265 days since he had seen them. When the emperor's son  Commodus  finds out about his father's favor towards the Spaniard  he kills his own father to become emperor  has his guards take Maximus out to kill him  but Maximus gets the upper hand and kills them all and  badly wounded on his left shoulder  rides towards home. Roman guards also destroy his home  and kill his wife and son. He sees this  passes out  and is a changed man.He is rescued and sold into slavery to become a gladiator in small venues in a remote Roman province. There  he quickly becomes a killing machine  and soon heads for the big time in Rome  where the new emperor is putting on ""150 straight days"" of gladiator games in the area.  The Romans are entertained by seeing gladiators kill each other  or Christian children eaten by lions.Ever since the old emperor was killed  then his family killed  Maximus's sole ambition was to face the emperor and get revenge. At their first face-to-face encounter  the Spaniard's popularity with the crowd kept him alive. Repeated ""traps"" were unsuccessful because Maximus was such a good fighter.Commodus borders on insane. He has a driving lust for his own sister  Lucilla  and tells her he wants a son by her so he can have his own legitimate heir to the throne  instead of her son by a now dead husband. Lucilla ends up helping in a plot to free Maximus who would return in a few days with an army of 5 000 to kill Commodus and restore some semblance of democracy  to fulfill the desires of the dead emperor. But insiders spoil that plot  kill Maximus' friend  and imprison him again.Finally  crazy Commodus wants to settle it in a fight in the arena between him and Maximus  man-to-man. But Commodus cheats - while Maximus is still shackled  Commodus stabs him deeply in the abdomen in what turns out to be a mortal wound. However  he has enough strength to first kill Commodus  and order all prisoners freed  and Rome freed  then Maximus dies and we see him  in dream-like sequences  joining his wife and son in the afterlife.A couple of things did not ring true.  Maximus was so much better than everyone else  and it is only barely credible that anyone could have fought out of all those situations. Also  I am not a student of Roman history  but I find it hard to believe that an emperor would get into the arena and fight a gladiator. Still  it is a good watch and I will see it again.",positive

I think I was a little too subtle with that  because after watching this movie for the first time in a year on the grand DVD  and I see why this film won best picture (though I still feel this is 2nd best to Traffic and Traffic was snubbed like Saving Pvt. Ryan in 99  only that Gladiator isn't mediocre like Shakespeare in Love is).Russell Crowe  as in all of his films commands the attention of the viewer every minute he's on the screen (though once again  Tom Hanks did it better though and also deserved the Oscar  but I'm not mad about it) as a man who is changed as he goes from respected general  to disgraced slave  and then back to respected Gladiator.

Exciting story. Well acted. This movie has every element of being an instant classic. Don't haggle about historical accuracy; just enjoy this epic with wild eyed anticipation. A story of love  vengeance and will power.Russell Crowe plays Maximus Meridius  a Roman general that winds up a gladiator after refusing to pledge loyalty the emperor's power-hungry son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). Emperor Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris)on his deathbed wants to turn the leadership of Rome over to Maximus; but the jealous Commodus smothers his already dying father to death and takes over the throne. Maximus escapes a death sentence and becomes a slave; then a gladiator that avenges his murdered family by constantly defying Commodus.
Crowe is excellent as is Phoenix. The two contrasting personae make a great rivalry. Connie Nielsen plays the sister of Commodus and the object of his sexual obsession. Stand outs in supporting roles are:Oliver Reed  David Schofield  Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings.From scene to scene the marvelous story flows and the music of Hans Zimmer orchestrates the many moods of the movie.

Virtually everything is a rehash  sometimes creative but mostly not. When someone or something comes along and adds to the vocabulary  something essentially new  it is a big deal -- that's my definition of genius. Today  a major force in defining our basic vocabulary is cinema  the visual element of filmaking. But all the easy stuff has been done as we leave the first generations of the art.So when someone comes along who can conceive a world that is new and unfamiliar  and who can actually deliver the illusion of being in that world  it is notable. Scott does that here (and in Blade Runner). Kubrick did it once or maybe twice; Polanski had the skills when he had an edge  but this is exceedingly rare. Note here how little quoting Scott does of prior battle in his battle scene  how Ben Hur (and all the lesser period pieces) are not at all referenced. How new this all is. (The only concession is the annoying British accent of the Romans.)What is remarkable is that it is all visual. It is not in the writing  the effects per se  or the acting  though they are all good enough. I intend to see this film several more times for just the visual experience. I suspect that because of the coherence and advance of the visual vocabulary. this will be seen as a landmark film long after Private Ryan and Titanic become footnotes.But there is also Crowe  and there's something notable here. I don't see great acting in the normal sense  but there is something else  and this seems new to me as well. To check this  I reviewed LA Confidential and The Insider. Crowe has the ability to develop tension  a normal enough skill  but he also has the ability to project this tension into the environment of the film. Watch how the scenes flow as his acting in one scene is tossed into another; it's remarkable.When he did this in The Insider  he seems to use as his resonator the unwitting  ever-bombastic Pacino. Here  He uses the similar exaggerated scope of the story  both the setting and the violence of the context.WARNING! Spoilers follow:Both Scott and Crowe seem to know what they are doing. So they have eliminated many of the elements normally required: there is no backstory  no explanation of what went before  no comic relief  just the barest of scaffolding. But in that  it is made of huge  strong girders. In another film  we'll have revenge driven by the death of the Hero's wife. Here  she and their child are gang-raped  burned until nearly dead  then crucified. In another film  the bad guy is conventionally bad  but here we have patricide and incestual rape. In another period film  we'd have lots of street scenes (which are cheap) to convey a sense of place: not so here. Nothing not essential to the core projection and resonant backdrop are used. So instead of parading the effects (as with Titanic or Jurassic Park)  they are handled casually  incidentally as background. Just a huge visual sweep through which tension is passed. It is early to know  but this could be one of the great films.,positive

I'd also agree that the Batman role in this and subsequent films was a bit one-dimensional--with a much greater emphasis on the villains and amazing cartoon-like scenes. However  despite enjoying the first film  the subsequent films were a disappointment to me as they just seemed overloaded with special effects and were a bit light on character development.In light of this  I really appreciated how the Batman character was hashed out and given much greater depth in BATMAN BEGINS--especially because it explains the long evolution of Bruce Wayne to caped crusader. Christian Bale was very good in the leading role and the story was very unusual but enjoyable to a point--though the plot did get awfully convoluted towards the end. In fact  I would say that the least interesting part of the film was the final conflict at the end  as this seemed a lot like previous Batman films--full of special effects but that's about all.Now my quibbles with BATMAN BEGINS are quite minor and I can't fault the movie too much because it doesn't pretend to be Shakespeare or a contender for a Sundance award! It is just old fashioned entertainment. Not especially deep  but entertaining.By the way  when I saw this film I was amazed at the high-priced talent organized for this film--Michael Caine  Gary Oldman  Liam Neeson  Katie Holmes  Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman. In particular  Freeman and Caine were terrific in the film.,positive

But it is an extremely good film  that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film's sophistication). People may find this blasphemy  but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight  but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is stylish  dark and gritty  pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film ""contradicts"" the 1989 film. Perhaps so  but what I can say in the film's defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies.Visually  Batman Begins looks absolutely incredible! It could very well be the most beautiful visually of the Batman films  with beautiful cinematography and a simply dazzling view of Gotham City itself. Another asset I appreciated was that the music score didn't overpower the action  in fact it gave some atmospheric flavour to it. As much as Danny Elfman's scores were outstanding and definitely memorable  Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard do a great job with the score.The script is taut and well-written with lines that really make you think along with some occasional offbeat humour  the plot isn't convoluted or predictable but original  the film moves briskly(the second half was marginally better in terms of pacing to the first half though but that is in no way a flaw) and the action is explosive particularly the climax and the bat-mobile car-chase. Also Christopher Nolan's direction is excellent.The acting  aside from the visuals is what drives the film. Christian Bale is for me the best Batman since Michael Keaton. In the role of Batman he is suitably dark and brooding  like Batman should be  and as Bruce Wayne  he is dashing  handsome and ambitious. Katie Holmes actually surprised me and in a good way. She wasn't bland or annoying  I actually found her sympathetic and surprisingly good. Liam Neeson is also very good  though he has been better  while Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Cillian Murphy  Tom Wilkinson and the excellent  underrated Gary Oldman are also solid in their roles  while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always.Overall  a brilliant film that is visually stunning  gripping and atmospheric. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",positive

Nolan dispenses with any previous cast or story lines  instead taking Batman back to his roots  and the result is a tough  violent  realistic adventure which isn't marred by any of the comic-book campness or flights of fancy which spoiled the others. Batman is just an ordinary guy here  without any superpowers  but instead his Bond-style gadgets allow him to become the caped crusader by night.The casting is extraordinary and the ensemble all give outstanding performances. Bale is terrific  finally getting some of the acclaim he deserves; I've been watching this guy for a few years now and he's been great in everything I've seen. Caine is cast as Alfred the butler  and supplies genuinely warm comedy and wit. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are friendly allies  although their roles are relatively minor. Katie Holmes is the attractive love interest and she  too  is surprisingly good. However  it's the villains which have the best parts; Liam Neeson has his best role in many years and is fantastic in it  whilst THE LAST SAMURAI's Ken Watanabe is creepy as a cult leader. Cillian Murphy (28 DAYS LATER) is truly memorable as weirdo bad guy The Scarecrow  whilst Tom Wilkinson is almost unrecognisable as a hardline gangster. Even Rutger Hauer is in it  and that's gotta be good  seeing as he's been stuck in DTV movie hell for a decade.The film is long – 2 ½ hours to be precise – but the suspense and action keep it moving. There are car chases  fist fights  massive battles and lots of other stuff going on. The plot keeps you guessing all the way through and there are plenty of surprising twists. My only complaint is that the action is cut too fast  and too close  so that it's pretty hard to see what's happening  but the excellent soundtrack helps make up for that. Still  a minor complaint with what is otherwise a flawless film – let's hope they all team up to make some more classics like this.,positive

Everything wrong with the previous four films is corrected here and since this movie got everything right I can now forget the first four films and just hope future sequels contain the same level of darkness  character and story development. What I enjoyed most about this film was that the characters were so well written and the Bruce Wayne character was given just as much strength as his Batman ego. I wasn't sure what to expect from Christian Bale but I'm glad the director kept his darkness and didn't try to lighten him up as an actor. The supporting players were also very well acted with a cast to die for. Liam Neeson  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are serious actors and they helped bring some seriousness to this comic book tale. It was also great seeing Gary Oldman playing a good guy. I always love rooting for his villains so rooting for him as a good guy just added more charm to the film. The only real weakness I found with the film was the poison gas  which just never really grabbed me as anything too interesting.,positive

It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer  Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham  he invents Batman.There are two things that keep this from an even more impressive start of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The first is Katie Holmes. She is not up to the task. She is still playing that little girl character from Dawson's Creek. She doesn't have the seriousness or gravitas to play this gutsy lawyer character. It's a big character  and not just another girlfriend.The second is that Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) isn't a big enough villain. The evil plan has too much of a silly Bond feeling. It is too unrealistic in a Batman movie that is suppose to be realistic. It leaves a bad taste for the climatic ending. Other than those two  this is still a great start to the trilogy. It sets the tone for the final two.,positive

Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are  of course  really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile  yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case  I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet  I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films.,positive

But we talked about that one on another occasion already and now lets take a look at the only film from the trilogy that is missing the ""Dark Knight"" in the title. The lead actor in this over 10-year-old film is of course Christian Bale still before his Oscar win and it's not about great acting from him here as it is all about the story. But still for example the likes of Neeson and Caine managed awards-worthy performances. It was a pretty good idea to have Wayne's mentor and trainer become his worst enemy at the very end and it also fits really well with Nolan's dark 0% comedy approach to Gotham City  very different from Burton or West or everybody else. It's almost a catastrophe movie  well with what is happening to Gotham it is and the tone fits in well  also with Bruce's emotional state. I personally could have done without the Scarecrow story as he felt rushed in  but he is also not a character to be a main antagonist for an entire film really  at least not with Murphy playing the character or Scarecrow's looks. Tough challenge. Maybe make the mafia boss or Hauer's character more influential instead with the time gained. Or just make it a 110-minute film.Freeman and Oldman well they were okay I guess  but also as I like them both I expected a bit more. Holmes at least brings in one female character and that's good. But in the center of it all  it is about Wayne making his peace with the past and finding his determination and destiny and like I said the way they used the League of Shadows (Neeson)  it was truly interesting in my opinion. People generally consider this film probably the second best from the trilogy after film number 2  but I would say it is my least favorite. That doesn't mean it was weak or anything though. It only means that the other two are better. At the end of this one here  we get a very interesting reference already about a certain clown character turning Batman's life into hell in the sequel. As for this one here  I recommend seeing it in the unlikely case that you still haven't. Only people who really hate superhero films should skip it and it's probably also not an essential watch to appreciate films 2 and 3. I know it is not a superhero film really  but still it is very similar. There are some lengths in the middle part and overlong action sequences  but these style-over-substance parts don't keep it from becoming a quality movie. Go check it out  these almost 2.5 hours certainly fly by.",positive

Being trapped in a cave full of bats as a child left him full of fear  and he can only blame himself for the death of his parents at the hands of a typical street thug. However time has perverted this hurt into a bitter  hollow anger that has led him to the Far East where he fights criminals behind bars  seemingly to seek to quench his thirst for what he sees as ""justice"". Taken into a remote training facility for the League of Shadows by Ducard  Wayne learns the arts of deception  movement  combat and others but when he understands that justice is death for this group he leaves and returns to Gotham City. In his absence  the city has fallen into corruption and crime and  seeking a symbol of fear for the criminals  Wayne uses his skills and considerable assets to try and bring down this rule by way of a vigilante personae  The Batman. However  with few allies in this fight  will he be able to counter more than the smaller fish in the pond?Although I don't agree with those IMDb users who have put this film into the top 250 ever made  I do see why they did it  because after the decreasing returns of the modern Batman films I was almost relieved that Begins made a massive leap away from the childish mess that Joel Schumacher had produced. Although not perfect  Nolan's Batman is dark where Schumacher's was day-glow; interesting where the other was puerile; exciting where the other was tiresome; this Wayne is a person where the other's was a child's action figure; this film almost stays in the real world where the other was set in some fantasy world that Schumacher must see when he shuts his eyes. So I can see why people love this film so much  it is such a massive jump up in quality that it is easy to see it as the greatest film ever made; compared to Batman & Robin this IS Citizen Kane. The plot sounds silly at the start but the structure of flashbacks and desolate reality make you forget of the lack of logic (or even explanation) behind Wayne being in prison. From here the training is swift and exciting while more cuts give us the back-story we already know. Back in Gotham Batman truly begins and the build up is as good as the delivery  he is not full of quips  in fact at first he is barely seen. While building the usual ""baddie with a big weapon"" story the film blends characters  other baddies  themes and action so naturally that it makes it look easy  but Schumacher will assure you it is not.Nolan's direction and the design of the film are big reasons for it working; although the material is fantastic  somehow it all feels like the real world and not like B&R for example. It feels gritty and it makes the characters more real and therefore interesting. Also appreciated is the fact that it is not only dark in visuals but also content. Personally I would have liked Wayne to have been more twisted and confused but what it did was good enough  more important though was how scary bits were  the Scarecrow  the paranoid visions  all combined to produce some dark images. Oh  and many thanks to the genius parents who saw this film advertised and thought ""hmm  a darker Batman film with a rating for over 12's  I know  I'll take my 4 year old to see that""; needless to say several families in my screening will not be aware of the ending of the film  who'd have though a 12A would frighten pre-school children? Tossers.The cast do well with what they have. Bale is a great Batman and I struggled to reconcile the man I saw with the man I saw a few months back in The Machinist. Although the script only gives him basic emotional building blocks and not a real inner struggle  Bale still does well with it and far from being the straightman to Batman's entertainer  his Wayne is the most interesting thing in the film. Neeson makes for a good trainer and his darkly interesting character does enough so that we accept the mythical body he represents. Holmes is OK  pretty good but really I could have coped without her character. Caine is a great choice for Albert and he seems to enjoy it. Freeman may have just followed the Alec Guinness model of taking the payday but he is also enjoyable Q to Bale's Bond (bet they wish their franchise had gotten him first). Murphy is interestingly creepy even before he becomes genuinely scary as his villain. Oldman does less than he is capable of but he is still a good addition  ditto with Wilkinson.Overall this is not one of the best films ever made but it is a great summer movie and  more importantly  it is a massive improvement on the Batman that Schumacher gave us  everything that it failed to do  this does well. A worthy blockbuster that is engaging  dark  exciting  scary and fun  well worth seeing and probably one of the better blockbusters this year.",positive

Where the new Bond (21st installment) was about to throw away the complete history of Bond as you knew it  Batman ""just"" reinvented the style of the two first movies. Yes I liked the first two Batmans  but I do also think that Nolan's Batman is better. Beginning by the costume (completely dark  instead of having something yellow on his chest  that would be like an easy target to shoot at) and goes on  with the man behind the mask. Beautifully played by Bale  who is supported by a great cast! A great drama with action in it ... what do you want more?",positive

But after seeing all three of the Dark Knight incarnations under Christopher Nolan  I'd have to say that his vision best defines the comic book character that evolved over the past decade. I never cared for the campy Adam West version of the mid-Sixties TV series  and even looking back at the early comic book stories  the appeal of the character was always geared more toward a kid's eye view of good guys triumphing over bad guys. With ""Batman Begins"" the character enters the adult world as a complex hero/anti-hero with conflicting emotions and a motivation in precarious balance between justice and revenge.Before the film came out I didn't know much about Christian Bale  and upon first viewing he didn't seem right for the Batman role  but watching today I think he fits it rather well. The only thing is  I'm put off somewhat by the look of the cowl that covers Batman's face. It's the one thing that hearkens back to a cartoony feel about the character and it's somewhat distracting for me. In fact  the whole idea of a rubberized Batman suit seems antithetical to the the early comic stories where the look of the character appeared more natural. One has to wonder how a real person would be able to move around in something like that.But when it comes to super-heroes  I enjoy origin stories and this one does it right. Beginning with the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents right up through his training under Ra's al Ghul  one gains an appreciation for the dedication and determination required to become a skilled warrior. Not to mention the mental and physical conditioning required to block out pain and exhaustion  an important element in creating the character.In addition to Bale  I found the supporting cast to be quite effective in their roles. Particularly intriguing was Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane. He didn't have as much screen time as some of the other players  but that crazed gleam in his eye made him believable as the founder of Arkham Asylum. Katie Holmes looked a bit young to be portraying the assistant DA of a major city like Gotham  but that could just be me. I liked Michael Caine as Alfred  a worthy collaborator in the Batman mystique and a trusted friend and adviser. All the rest were good too  Liam Neeson  Gary Oldman  Tom Wilkinson  and Rutger Hauer - all exceedingly competent and well cast for their characters.",positive

Therefore  we would have to figure that even if ""Batman Begins"" was atrocious  it couldn't be any worse than ""B&R"". Well  we needn't worry: this one is very well done. Maybe not a ""Citizen Kane""-style masterpiece  but definitely worth seeing. I'm not surprised at all  given that it's in the hands of ""Memento"" director Christopher Nolan.As the title identifies  this movie tells the story of how wealthy Gotham City heir Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) became the Caped Crusader (is it unacceptable to use that name  considering the dark nature of this movie?). Specifically  we get to see how various and sundry incidents forced him to face his fears directly  no matter how unpleasant the situation could be. And there are plenty of unpleasant situations to experience in a Chinese prison. Ah  but a Tibetan training camp can teach a person the most unimaginable skills. And that's just what they do with Bruce.Back in Gotham City  Bruce moves back into Wayne Manor  where butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) has lived alone for seven years. In that time  gangster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has risen to prominence  bought out all the politicians  and completely turned the city into his playground. Only reporter Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) has the courage to investigate him. Now that Bruce Wayne is donning a bat costume  there may actually be law enforcement. But wait until you find out what the crime syndicate is actually planning.Far from the idiocy in the previous Batman movie  the plot here is very cleverly constructed. The aforementioned cast members all do very well in their roles. Also starring are Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard  who helps Bruce pick himself back up; Gary Oldman as honest cop Jim Gordon  assisting Batman; Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane  who has a lot in store; Ken Watanabe as Ra's Al Ghul  who trains Bruce; Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox  providing Bruce with all the devices necessary; plus Rutger Hauer and Linus Roache.All in all  a very well done movie. True  some of the action sequences are a little silly  but never stupid. And certainly  this movie has some of the best advice that I've ever heard in an action movie.",positive

I was originally skeptical when I saw the Urban Assault Vehicle in the trailer  but my fears were calmed when I saw it in context. Everything about this film is perfect - the acting  the directing  the mood  the plot  and all else. It is rare to see such intricate storytelling mixed with bone-shattering intensity in the action department. And fans of the comic will not be disappointed with this apt translation.I hope Chris Nolan directs all future Bat-movies  because his lighting and architectural canvasing was so perfect  it outdid Tim Burton's interpretation (which I previously thought impossible). As of this review  IMDb has rated the movie #117 of all time  and I agree completely. This film has universal appeal. Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne  Katie Holmes actually acts for once in her career  Liam Neeson is the quintessential villain. Other stars shine brightly. I can only hope that Crispin Glover becomes the Joker in the sequel. Highest possible recommendation...,positive

Basically  in flashback  eight year old Bruce Wayne gained a fear of bats from falling into a cavern and being surrounded and terrified by them  and he suffered the loss of his parents Thomas (Priest's Linus Roache) and Martha (Sugar Rush's Sara Stewart) when they were murdered right in front of him. As an adult there was a point when Bruce (Christian Bale) wanted to kill the man responsible  Joe Chill (Richard Brake)  when he was granted parole  but someone working for gangster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson)  so to get the justice he wants he relocated to Asia to a Bhutanese prison to learn the ways of the League of Shadows. He learns the skills of the ninja and fighting while he is training with Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson)  and the leader was Ra's Al Ghul  but when he was near completing the training he found out that the true intentions of the league are to return to his home  Gotham City  and destroy the city  so he reacts by burning the temple and escaping  saving Ducard's life in the process. Having returned to Gotham  Bruce is now determined to build up the empire that his family created  taking over the technology and defence conglomerate Wayne Enterprises  and he wants to make the company public  but of course he still wants to find a way to get revenge and justice for the death of his parents. He sees an opportunity to do this when he is introduced to the company's experimental prototype technologies  including a protective bodysuit and an armoured car  all looked after by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman)  and creates the persona for justice and fear for criminals  based on his fear of bats  he becomes Batman. As Batman he manages to stop the shipment of illegal drugs  controlled by Falcone  and he manages to catch the mobster and have him arrested  handed over to up and coming police detective Sergeant James 'Jim' Gordon (Gary Oldman)  and at the same time as this an experimental weapon called a ""Microwave Emitter"" that has the potential to wipe out the water supply has been stolen. Declared mentally unfit for trial by the corrupt Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy)  Falcone is transferred to Arkham Asylum  and there the scientist exposes the gang lord to his dangerous hallucinogenic drug and his ""Scarecrow"" mask to terrify him and drive him insane with fear. Batman is exposed to the fear toxin as well  but his faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth (Sir Michael Caine) rescues him  and an antidote to the toxin is created by Fox  and before exposing her to the toxin as well  Crane reveals his plan to Bruce's childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) that he plans to use the city's water supply to expose all citizens to the dangerous drug. Rachel helps Batman catch Crane  and exposes him to it and give him a taste of his own medicine  so that he will reveal more about the plan to spread the toxin throughout Gotham City  and it is on the night of his birthday in Wayne Manor that Bruce is confronted by Crane's boss  Ducard  who is still alive  and his true identity is Ra's Al Ghul. Obviously wanting to fulfil the plan of the League of Shadows  Ducard explains that the Microwave Emitter is what will create the chain reaction for the release of the fear toxin in the city's water supply  and this will create mass hysteria and destruction with the citizens being terrified by the horrific things they hallucinate. After revealing his true identity to Rachel  Batman sets out to stop Ra's Al Ghul  using the train system to deliver the weapon to the Wayne Enterprises tower and trigger the chain reaction  and with the bridge collapsed with the help of Gordon the train is stopped from reaching its destination  and Ra's Al Ghul dies in the crash of the vehicle. In the end Rachel cannot see a way to love Bruce while he is Batman  who has become a public hero for saving the city  and Bruce buys all his shares in his family's company  firing CEO William Earle (The Hitcher's Rutger Hauer) and replacing him with Fox  Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant  the bat-signal is created to call the caped crusader when there is trouble  and it ends with Batman saying he will investigate a new criminal who leaves his calling card  a Joker playing card. Also starring Ken Watanabe as the fake Ra's Al Ghul  Memento's Mark Boone Junior as Flass  The Fast Show's Colin McFarlane as Loeb and Thunderbirds' Shane Rimmer as Older Gotham Water Board Technician. Bale is sarcastic while being playboy Bruce and suitably rough and ready (with a put on voice) as the Dark Knight  and Neeson as the wise but malevolent criminal mastermind and Murphy as the creepy mad doctor do great as the villains  the origins of how the orphaned boy psychologically transformed into the dark figure for justice makes for good plot  and of course all the fighting  explosions and special effects to create the excitement don't disappoint  a terrific action fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography  and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects  Best Production Design and Best Sound.

In the prologue we see a young Bruce Wayne fall into a well where he is terrified by the bats he disturbed; creating a life long phobia. The first time we see him as an adult he is in a Himalayan prison; he is released and invited to train to become part of an organisation called the crime fighting organisation; League of Shadows. Upon completing his training he learns that the league's methods are radical in the extreme... they intend to destroy Wayne's home city of Gotham and everything in it because they believe the world needs to be cleansed of its corruption. Gotham is indeed a corrupt city but Wayne is determined that it can be saved. He returns home and uses the resources of Wayne Industries to create his Batman persona.This takes almost to the half way point of the film; in the second half we see him start his fight against those corrupting the city; the first person he goes against is local mobster Carmine Falcone; he may be the city's best known mobster but unbeknownst to him he was working for others; the psychiatrist Dr. Crane used Falcone to smuggle psychotropic drugs into the city; he used these to experiment on patients at the Arkham Asylum in preparation for the attack on the city being planned by the League of Shadows. If Batman is to thwart the League's plans he will have to confront his deepest fears and risk losing everything he has. He has few allies; just a policeman  Sgt. Gordon; his butler Alfred; Assistant DA and childhood friend  Rachel Dawes and demoted company researcher  Lucius Fox.Before watching this put any memories of the camp '60s TV show or the '80s films out of your minds; this is a complete reboot that is in no way connected to them and tells the story from the characters beginning. The first half of the film is less action packed as it deals with how Bruce loses his parents  struggles to come to terms with that loss and is trained by the Henri Ducard of the League of Shadows... this doesn't mean this section was any less interesting; in fact I found this to be an essential as it gave us the necessary insight into Batman's motivations rather than just expecting the viewer to accept that Bruce Wayne likes to fights crime dressed as a giant bat. The second half is packed with plenty of exciting action and it is fun to see some of Batman's famous gadgets; especially the new and imaginatively designed bat mobile. The gadgets aren't overdone though; he doesn't always have just the right piece of highly specialised kit!The cast is full of top quality actors including Christopher Bale as Bruce Wayne  Michael Caine  Morgan Freeman  Liam Neeson  Gary Oldman and Rutger Hauer... but it doesn't feel like an 'all-star cast' film where everybody gets a chance to show off; each of the cast plays their part well without overplaying it. This has a far more realistic feel than previous Batman films; the villains are entirely human without over the top mannerisms or camp costumes and because so much time was spent introducing the Bruce Wayne character he is the real character and Batman is just a costume he wears and even that is given a practical justification. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of intelligent action films; even if you don't usually like superhero films this one is worth checking out.,positive

It's a plane! No -- it's a flying squirrel!,2014-08-13,"It's reaching a point at which I no longer have any idea of what to make of these comic-book derived superhero movies. The budget must have been lavish. You ought to see Gotham. The glass boxes of yesteryear have become a little more baroque  so that Batman can swing from cartouche to Churrigueresque spatial decoration. Actually  he does do a lot of swinging  as well as zipping up and down  but he doesn't have to. He can leap from the top of a skyscraper and flutter his way elsewhere like a flying squirrel. Somewhere in the silent film archives is a short shot of a man jumping from a platform wearing a pair of wings strapped to his arms. He falls immediately to earth. Batman doesn't. He just make a loud fluttering noise  as of a bat. He also has a lot of gadget and an armor suit and what-not -- not including a gun -- that makes it possible for him to do impossible things.Where did he learn his principles  after his mother and father were killed by a poor person in the bifurcated society of the future? And where did he pick up his mano-a-mano combat skills? And where did he find all those gadgets that make James Bond look like a tyro? Christian Bale got them from a host of first-rate supporting players  including Liam Neeson as his faux guru  Morgan Freeman as the custodian of armor and weapons too expensive to sell to the army  Gary Oldman as one of the few upright police officers in Gotham  and Michael Caine as the ever-helpful Alfred. Every one of them is splendid. Even the villainous parts -- Rutger Hauer  for instance -- are neatly delivered  and Cillian Murphy  as the psychiatrist who has developed a hallucinogenic substance to poison Gotham's water supply  is superbly prissy and haughty. Tom Wilkinson is fine too  as Carmine Falcone  one of the honchos who will bring the city to its delirious knees. I thought I saw John Hurt in the cast  but no -- a dead ringer. Katie Holmes is very nice to look at  with her cherubic face  but she isn't given much to do.There is some mumbo jumbo about ""finding your inner self"" and all that. ""In order to conquer fear you must become fear "" intones Liam Neeson somewhere in Tibet. But the acting and the Philosophy for Dummies are all distractions for the real star of the movie -- the special effects. They've turned the Batmobile into what one cop describes hesitantly as ""a tank."" The visual effects are overwhelming. They are to the rest of the movie what a wrecking ball is to the abandoned tenement it destroys.If you like special effects  especially those that reveal a city on which the sun never shines  although the rainfall is copious  this is your movie. You'll just have to sit through a little thoughtful advice on how to come to terms with your anger -- and you don't get the girl at the end  either.",positive

It was like a documentary to me  about a topic I was interested in. In fact  on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more.Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman. It's too bad there have been so many actors playing this role  ruining the continuity of this latest series. I hope Bale continues with a few more efforts with this character.It was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of ""Alfred."" He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story. Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role  or romantic one  as I expected  and that was fine with me. I just enjoyed looking at her face  leaving it go at that. Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner Gordon in all the other episodes (but  once again  played by another actor.)The film ends with what would be the beginning of the first Batman  featuring ""The Joker.""After having seen all the Batman films several times  I now think is the best of them all....perhaps an unpopular choice  but that's my opinion.

Goyer focuses strongly on Wayne's inner conflict between seeking revenge and delivering justice (while neatly addressing some of the character's more questionable issues—most notably  how he learnt to fight and where he gets his cool gadgets from).With a fine supporting cast  impressive production design (Gotham city is suitably gloomy and rain drenched and Batman's suit  accessories and vehicle are impressively utilitarian) and top-notch special effects  I certainly can't accuse Nolan of not pulling out all the stops.And yet Batman Begins still feels strangely lacking. Nolan's fussy direction is partly to blame  the action scenes a chaotic blur of close-ups and quick edits that seriously diminish the level of excitement  but perhaps the film's biggest problem is the simple lack of fun and imagination. Compared with the 80s/90s movies  Batman Begins' new approach feels frustratingly conventional  afraid to be even the slightest bit daring or playful for fear of being compared to its immediate predecessor.I'm not for a second suggesting the reinstatement of rubber nipples on Batman's body armour  but Nolan's grim vision has gone just a bit too far in the opposite direction for my liking.6.5 out of 10  but not good enough for me to round it up to 7 for IMDb.,positive

Superb!,2005-10-23,"June 2014 update: Just watched it again on Blu-ray and it still holds up ver well.January 2011 update: I watched it on Blu-ray and the additional clarity and sound are definitely worth it for a movie like this. July 2008 update: We watched this again today as a prelude to the new one  'Dark Knight'  hitting local screens today. My opinion of this one has not changed!I rarely buy DVD movies anymore  what with my public library's vast collection for free  and the absolute dearth of worthwhile movies the past few years. But I bought this one  the deluxe special edition  such was my anticipation of a superb movie. I was not disappointed. If anything  it is even better than I had hoped. I am still a fan of the other Batman movies  but this one is on another level by itself. As the title suggests  this Batman movie really is the story of how it all begins. From the experiences of Bruce Wayne  the child  to Bruce Wayne who begins to fight crime and accept his new role as savior of crumbling Gotham City. It has less of a comic book flair  more of a real gritty look at a mortal man learning the skills to become a super hero  cuts and bruises and all.Christian Bale was so good as the skinny machinist in the movie of that name  he is quite a contrast here as the muscular but svelte Bruce Wayne/Batman. I think Michael Caine was a perfect choice to play his loyal assistant Alfred. The essence of Bruce Wayne's preparation for his crime fighting role is in a far away place in snowy mountains  where he is mentored by the character played by Liam Neeson. Much later  this character shows up as a menace that must be defeated. I believe Katie Holmes has received unfair criticism as Rachel Dawes  the childhood friend of Bruce's who now works in the DA's office. I enjoyed her role in the movie and think it fits well.I am so used to seeing Gary Oldman play a bad guy  it was refreshing to see him as the good cop who  in the end  becomes a key player in Batman's fight against the men who want to destroy Gotham. Always dependable Morgan Freeman turns in another perfect performance as Lucius Fox  smart and loyal employee of Wayne Industries  under-appreciated until the very end  and who helps Bruce Wayne assemble much of his fighting toys and Batmobile.(As an aside  it is interesting that so many actors from Europe were playing 'American' roles with American accents  including Christian Bale  Rutger Hauer  Tom Wilkinson  and Gary Oldman  but they all pulled them off quite well.) ""Batman Begins"" - a new favorite of mine. The DVD picture and sound are great as expected  with very nice and interesting extras.SPOILERS -- SPOILERS. As Bruce Wayne begins to realize and accept his mission  the crisis arrives in the form of bad guys  led by Neeson's character  planning to destroy Gotham by putting a debilitating chemical into the water supply. But it only is activated via the lungs  so they also steal a powerful microwave generator which can vaporize water in the water supply. Bruce and a couple of others get inoculation  the plot is foiled by Batman  assisted when the high speed train carrying the generator is made to crash and the villain is also destroyed. At the end  Batman gets the calling card for his next nemesis  'The Joker.'",positive

In reading some of the reviews posted here  I realize that I missed a lot of Batman over the years. Apparently this franchise went way wrong (uh  did it start with the Clooney version?)  and people were nervous about seeing this one.All I know about the Batman cartoon is that his parents were killed leaving the movies after having seen ""The Mark of Zorro."" Not a Warner Brothers movie  so you can forget that.This film purports to tell the story of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. I'm not sure how much it sticks to the cartoon Batman  but it's terrific just the same. Bruce (Christian Bale) struggles with his anger and bitterness over the death of his parents. He becomes involved with the League of Shadows  a group with a very extreme mission  where he learns a lot of survival techniques. Wayne finally settles on trying to do some good for the broken down  crime-ridden  mob-infested Gotham -especially when he learns that the League of Shadows plans to annihilate it.No expense was spared either for the cast or the effects  and there are some amazing ones. The casting is inspired: the handsome Bale is a perfect Bruce/Batman  who manages to hold his emotions inside; Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler - fabulous casting  and one really sees the bond beween Alfred and Bruce; the brilliant Tom Wilkinson as the evil Carmine Falcone; Liam Neeson as an instructor in the League of Shadows; Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox  who works for Wayne's company  which is in danger of being stolen from Bruce. The only off-note for me was the casting of Katie Holmes as an assistant district attorney. She came off like a high school student. Age-wise  as a childhood friend of Wayne's  she's in the right age range  but Holmes seems much younger than her years.This is a dark  brooding film that combines the effects with human drama. Really a great film.",negative

The Batman saga was revived by Tim Burton and it started under auspicious skies with the two following novel chapters: ""Batman"" (1989) and ""Batman Returns"" (1992). With the arrival of Joel Schumacher  the series plumbed. ""Batman Forever"" (1995) and ""Batman and Robin"" (1997) were real downers which tarnished Batman's reputation. Due to this  Gotham City's most well-known inhabitant took refuge in his den and waited for things to evolute. In the meantime  he was upstaged by other superheroes like ""Spiderman"". Was there a future for Kane's son? Rather than pouncing on the elaboration of a new adventure (at one point  one even talked about the possibility of a story called ""Batman vs Superman"")  why not plumping for a streak which has been seizing the Hollywood firm for several years? Just look at the titles of the following works: ""the Exorcist: the Beginning"" (2004"" or recently ""the Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the Beginning"" (2006). These titles give this inkling: to go back to the sources and roots and unearth what made Batman a myth. Like many moviegoers on this site  when I learned that Christopher Nolan was the heir of this work  I felt that the project was in good hands. I'm not a fan of his ""Memento"" (2000) but I recognize that he's a canonical filmmaker and this was largely conducive to Batman's rehabilitation.The storyline is apparently slick on the surface  but in depth it conceals several directions. More than half of the storytelling is based on Bruce Wayne's psychological turmoil  His trip in the world to forget the traumatizing death of his parents under his eyes. His apprenticeship and learning to gain trust and knowledge and to try to overcome his demons and to put a term to his weaknesses. As Liam Neeson puts it: ""you are afraid of your own strength"". But eventually  the young man will have recourse to his own fears to fight fear! To admire the hero  you'll have to be very patient for one can't see him before almost the half of the film. The second half which sees the young cape crusader going back to Gotham City to make justice triumph and creating some of his gadgets which cemented his popularity like the ""Batmobile"" is more devoted to action sequences. These thrilling moments keep a very reserved feeling to insist that Batman is a flesh and blood protagonist. It is more embellished by a restricted use of special effects. But Nolan and his scenarist didn't put aside rigor and construction. The development of the story is fantastic as one could wish with twists  turns to keep the audience interested. Apparently the scarecrow wants to command Gotham City but the biggest villain isn't necessarily the one you can think of.Even ""Batman Begins"" is a typical Hollywood product  it is earmarked of Nolan's touch. The filmmaker deftly introduces flashbacks at the right time and sometimes flashbacks inside flashbacks! And Nolan once said that he liked to oppose the subjectivity of a character to the objectivity of the world. This declaration could make sense in one of the thrusts developed in the film: many inhabitants in Gotham City may think that justice is lost but Bruce Wayne/Batman is back and here to stay to convince them that it's not dead. The setting helps to capture this and Nolan's own ominous vision of the city: a Gotham City shrouded with a gritty urban realism and in which bribery and violence easily propagate due to the power of the underworld. This assumed perspective breaks out in the apocalyptic end of the film which in a certain extent harks back to George Romero's cult film ""the Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) with the population wandering in a hazy  artificial fog in the throes of fear and madness. Thanks to Nolan's stringent brio  these different levels in the scenario and in the directorial style are combined to amount to a meshed  well-rounded poise shot without alacrity. An overlong movie (2h 20 minutes) but the length eludes the viewer.For this resurrection of Batman  Nolan gathered a stellar cast. Every actor slips into his or her role in an unselfconscious way. Christian Bale can preen himself on having got the role of his life and he has never been so much better than here. Michael Caine brings a mix of complicity and mischievousness to the butler Alfred and I have a preference for Cilian Murphy whose cynicism and deadly charm have positively devastating effects.For Nolan  the transition from a ""film d'auteur"" to a Hollywood blockbuster wasn't knotty at all and even if the whole seems easy  it's very bracing. So thank you Mr. Nolan for having re gilded Batman's credibility. The follow-up is currently under way. Let's hope it will showcase the same high standard of quality.",positive

The last Batman film  Batman & Robin  committed the later crime  and put a stigma on the franchise for several years. But now there is Christopher Nolan  talented director behind the cult favorite Memento  and the under-rated Insomnia remake of 2002  who has taken the origins of the Dark Knight into a different direction  or at least to a better one. His film  Batman Begins  has the power  has the entertainment  and it doesn't cheat its target audience (the die-hard Batman fans) or the general public. There isn't as much humor as the first film (this film's only tiny liability)  but there is that genuine dark sensibility that can take in kids as well as adults. That the story and characters are as important as the action sequences and fights is another bonus.The cast Nolan has put together is no less better than expected. Christian Bale is  arguably  a more compelling Bruce Wayne/Batman than Michael Keaton  or at the least he tries to put some feeling into his performance in ways that either Keaton didn't do or just in a different way. Since Nolan has license to reinvent the series  he changes around certain elements with Batman's origin (that I will not reveal here)  and it brings about some changes in the line-up. Michael Caine is a good butler Alfred; Morgan Freeman is dependable as always as Batman's supplier; Gary Oldman this time is Gordon; and Nolan is also wise in not only Bruce's quasi-love interest (played by Katie Holmes  not too bad)  but also in character actors like Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane. And there's also Liam Neeson  in an unlikely (though maybe familiar- Star Wars/Kingdom of Heaven?) mentor for Wayne to form his alter-ego.Simply this- Batman Begins works because as a summer popcorn action blockbuster  it's definitely not too dumb or tire-bound in clichés (not that there aren't a few  which is a given)  and it keeps enough adrenaline and surprises with the action/set pieces. The classic  Gothic look of Burton's films is gone for the most part  but what's replaced by Nolan is often creepy and urban (if at least a consistent color of browns)  which gives Gotham a cool edge;sometimes I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. And I liked how Nolan did certain things with the structure of the story early on- which is his specialty as a true-blue professional- in a kind of non-linear way  keeping the audience off balance but not too much to know where things were headed. Basically  if you've been waiting over ten years for a Batman movie that works  this is it.,positive

Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically  the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia  it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film.

True  the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye  whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten  that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great  a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki  though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man  Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury  Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton)  Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest  heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too  Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional  imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here  Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed)  in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour  pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script  filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall  Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it  and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant  just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

I went into it expecting not to like it much  and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy  a whole lot of posturing  and a silly storyline involving silly characters.Then things changed. They started to pick up  and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour  an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant  wide-scale mayhem  but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory.And yes  I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like  really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure  I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing  overblown CGI mayhem  replete with a silly  buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride.,negative

I'll be honest and admit that comic book movies aren't my #1 type of film and it wasn't until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies  thought THOR was very good  THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldn't prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really can't help but think he's raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together  the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasn't the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasn't a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes  which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact  the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but there's no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction  the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up.,positive

Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang  and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing  this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly  TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun.,positive

But after three Iron Men and now this  I see a sameness in them all  and I'm not equipped properly to enjoy them as I should. I'm still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at  the special effects are beyond belief  and some of the characters have some dimension. That said  I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character  what his or her powers are  and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid  so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it  however  they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. It's like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. It's a cast of characters what represent simple things  both good and evil. I'll leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines.,negative

The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me.There are lots of movies that use ""movie geography"" that makes no sense and they don't all use CGI.

The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon  at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story  the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now  this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJ's Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all  Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy  drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments  but that's also subjective.This film was nominated for its special effects for a BAFTA and an Oscar and lost both times to Life of Pi. Of course  fitting the box office success  it received many other honors during the award season back then. At slightly over 140 minutes  it is a really long watch indeed and I think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2-hour-mark. But I still take it as it is as there wasn't a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration. Back to the villain  Loki may have been the primary antagonist here  but there is a lot more conflict in here  most of all the Avengers managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause. It's a long way to that. And when it's finally done  Loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the ""other end of the universe"" as they were saying. So what was the best thing here? Yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths. And I am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here  but also for example about the more subtle effects like what Iron Man sees written in his mask.So yeah  overall I think this was a good watch. Everybody will have their favorites from the cast  but as the film is so long  every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time. For me  these would be Jackson  Renner and ScarJo of course  even if I must admit that SLJ's character did not do a whole lot for me in here. It's a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun. It's of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish  but it's still a success and not just in quality  but also definitely from the commercial perspective. No surprise number 3 is coming out soon. Still the IMDb and RT ratings may be a bit too high to be honest. Nonetheless  if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on IMDb  it really is high time to finally go check it out. Today was the second (or third) time I watched it and I think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch. Go for it  especially if you like Marvel films. I give this first (new) Avengers film a thumbs-up. The character are really interesting and fun to watch  not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes.",positive

The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film – a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though  a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though  the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines  rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn't particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same  with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am)  these aliens aren't really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection  Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it  giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the ""puny god"" moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans  who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk  again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces  none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes  nothing something that always delivers  but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful  busy  fun and generally very entertaining – it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this.",positive

It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I don't think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks)  the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again  he is god  so he wouldn't care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed  I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you  this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers  than it is about any villain. And I don't think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you don't realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact  that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it won't be many)  but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.Since this is a Marvel movie  you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. You'll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet  was not shown in Europe  but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD  Blu Ray or whatever comes next). I'm so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice  but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ...,negative

I've been around since Stan Lee created Spider-Man  and some of the other Marvel super-heroes were around even before I was born. So I grew up at a time when the technology wasn't up to the task of putting what we see in today's Avengers on the big screen. With that said  it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle  so if that's what you're all about  you won't be disappointed. However if you're looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot  you've come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works  but I need something more  even in a super-hero movie.With that out of the way  there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters. Of all the players  Robert Downey Jr. probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of Iron Man. He's out there  he's serious when he has to be  and he's a wise guy when the situation warrants. As for the the CGI Hulk - who ever thought he'd wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this? He had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life  the rag doll whipping on old Loki (Tom Hiddleston)  and the sidearm swat to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that was so outrageous it just brought the house down.Apart from some of the witty comic book dialog  the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects  exceptionally well done of course  but gosh  how much can a city take? Which by the way  is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a super-hero barrage when a cosmic power like Loki comes to town. How about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against Iron Man  Thor and Hulk for destroying their city? Just kidding - how are you going to get them to court? Say  I know Stan Lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these Marvel flicks  so I was glad to see he showed up here  even though it was probably his quickest one ever. If you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle. It's going to be a sad day when Lee won't be around any more to make these appearances.And now for my final rant - as I write this  ""The Avengers"" has  in just two days  made it to #31 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Films. My post will be #495  so in less than a full weekend  movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this picture? Personally  if I were making the rules  I'd allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release  but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after it's come out. OK  maybe six months. I think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system  and someone like Joss Whedon wouldn't have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great films.Back to ""The Avengers"" - stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing Avengers flick. You know they'll be there because Nick Fury said so. THANOS!!! You think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film? I'd bet on it.",negative

This year alone has already seen ""Black Panther"". I won't deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. ""The Avengers"" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters  Sheldon Coopers  Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London"").

Currently  it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now  no matter how good you think it is  does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean  really? I grew up reading comic books  so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base  which is good  because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is  for example  it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk  who is not a team player. This was addressed.,positive

Basically Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)  director of S.H.I.E.L.D.  is meeting some colleagues in a remote facility where the energy source the Tesseract has been found and activated  opening a gateway transporting the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from Asgard to Earth. He steals the powerful cube and takes over the minds of personnel like Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård)  and this forces Fury to reactivate the Avengers Initiative  recruiting some of the world's most powerful and special heroes  starting with Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). She goes to find Bruce Banner aka The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) who is hiding somewhere in India for his scientific knowledge of the Tesseract - no mention of ""The Other Guy""  while Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) approaches Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) who also has technological knowledge - and his powerful mechanical suit  and Fury also brings Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) up to date with the situation  and he is still trying to get used to the modern world. While Loki disappeared into the abyss he was approached by the alien race the Chitauri  led by The Other (Alexis Denisof)  and they came to an agreement that if they got the Tesseract they would help him take over the Earth. Suited up  Captain America and Iron Man travel to Germany where Loki is meant to be hiding and trying to ignite and stabilise the power of the cube  showing his evil intent to many people kneeling before him  he surrenders though when they fight and catch him. In this process though the villain's half-brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives  also transported from Asgard  and he plans to take and deal with him in his own way  and this turns into a fight between him  Iron Man and Captain America  but it eventually stops. Loki is placed into a cell  designed to hold The Hulk inside if Banner turns  and now with Thor recruited as well the Avengers argue about how to handle the alien dictator  and there is the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plan to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Fury explains that he heard about what happened in Mexico  when Thor was previously on Earth  and that the attack makes Earth an easy target  and the weapons will be good defence for a similar attack  and as the argument continues Loki's mind controlled agents infiltrate the ship  the Helicarrier. Captain America and Iron Man try to start the engines again  while Thor tries fight against Banner who has become The Hulk and may destroy the ship from the inside  and fighting with Barton  Romanoff discovers a hard hit to the head will knock possessed people back to normal. In the struggle Loki kills Agent Coulson and escapes the ship  Banner as Hulk and Thor are ejected from the ship and fall to the ground  and Fury uses the death of Coulson to encourage the Avengers left to come together  work as a team and save the world. They know that the villain wants to become ruler as well as destroy cities  and using Dr. Selbig he has created a device to open the gateway and allow the Chitauri to invade and attack Manhattan  and it is up to Captain America  Iron Man  Black Widow  Hawkeye  Thor and The Hulk to save the day. In the end  after Dr. Selvig is revived  so much explosive fighting  and a prevented missile blowing up in space  Loki is taken back with the Tesseract by Thor to Asgard  the Avengers go their separate ways  until a new threat to the world emerges  and the final scene sees The Other meeting his master  who turns and reveals himself to be Thanos. Also starring Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill  Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts  Paul Bettany as Jarvis  Sudden Death's Powers Boothe as World Security Council  Jenny Agutter as World Security Council  Harry Dean Stanton as Security Guard  Lou Ferrigno as the voice of The Hulk and a cameo by Stan Lee. The cast are all fantastic  Downey Jr. with all the quips  Evans as the sensible fighter  Ruffalo as the man trying to control his temper  Hemsworth as the arrogant warrior  Johansson as the confident female  and Jackson as the intelligent controller. It should be noted that the title was changed in Britain from The Avengers because there would be confusion with the Honor Blackman/Dianna Rigg TV series  and also there were small complaints about Spider-Man and Wolverine absent  but it doesn't matter. Anyway  the story and scripting are very well made  and what steals the show is the brilliantly paced fight sequences filled with the most spectacular and ground breaking special effects to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks  invading creatures  and constant explosions  this is definitely one of the greatest superhero movies of the last few years  a must see action fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects  and it was nominated the BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. Very good!",positive

Using his powers he steals the Tesseract and takes control of scientist Dr Erik Selvig and SHIELD agent Clint Barton. He intends to give the Tesseract to The Other in exchange for an army to conquer Earth. First he will have to gain certain items to open a large enough portal for his army. Meanwhile SHIELD director Nick Fury assembles the world's superheroes to battle Loki. They aren't natural team players and are soon bickering and fighting amongst themselves. Loki is captured with surprising ease almost as if being captured was part of his plan.If you are a fan of the superhero genre then I'm sure this will be a must see; if like me you aren't exactly a fan of the genre but do enjoy the occasional superhero film then this is one that is worth watching. The fact that it includes several varied superheroes is rather fun. Having only seen the 'Iron Man' films and the old '70s Hulk TV series I wasn't familiar with most of them but that didn't really matter as it soon becomes apparent what powers each of them have and the reason for those powers isn't really important. There is lots of action throughout this is all pretty exciting and the technology they use looks great; I particularly liked the Helicarrier  a flying aircraft character reminiscent of the 'Cloud Base' in 'Captain Scarlet' only this one is introduced to us when it is in the water. Even on a fairly small scene the climactic scenes look good but would recommend watching on the largest screen you can to get the full effect. The cast does a fine job making their unbelievable characters believable. Overall I'd say this is a fine example of the genre that is suitable for all but younger children.,positive

And I had read up on the hype around this movie  so I might as well give it a go as well.And as a fairly non-superhero kind of guy  well I must say that ""The Avengers"" was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie. The story was  for me at least  rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal. Sure  it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies.The effects in ""The Avengers"" were top notch  as to be expected from a movie of this caliber. Lots of really great effects and visuals. However  when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly  I was ready to turn off the movie. That was just silly. But I decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene.However  one thing did make me wonder  with all the destruction in New York  you didn't see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way  that was just stupid  especially with so many people living there. In fact  you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie  which was sort of lame.Another thing puzzled me  when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk for the first time in the movie  he was out of control  smashing everything and everyone in sight. But somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time. That just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation.And as with the previous Marvel movies with these characters  they had some great performances to the movie. I think that it was actually Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most.""The Avengers"" was good entertainment  even for an anti-superhero guy like myself.

The USA  NASA  and the World Council are all interested in the small cube of energy captured at one time  it allows a portal to a different part of the universe. When it gets a mind of its own in the lab  the mythical god Loki appears with a giant burst of energy  and right away we see he is up to no good. If he can position the energy cube outside  pointed to the sky  his legions will be able to enter and take over the Earth. The main star  in a movie filled with stars  is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man. We also have Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Captain America  Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk  Chris Hemsworth as Thor  Loki's brother  Scarlett Johansson (my favorite) as Natasha Romanoff and Black Widow  and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton and Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is good and sinister as Loki.We eventually find out  after Tony Stark figures it out  that Loki's approach is to alienate each human superhero against the others  divide and conquer. Humans are eventually saved when the six superheros band together and each uses his and her special powers to defeat the aliens.Of course there is lots of action  much of it taking place on a very large aircraft carrier that can transform itself into a giant flying carrier. Then the final action is in Manhattan  with quite a bit of destruction. In the end it is Stark as Iron Man that diverts a missile with a nuclear warhead  steering it through the upper opening of the portal  destroying the mothership which was responsible for keeping the battle going.Other key characters were Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson  pretty Cobie Smulders dressed in a sleek black outfit as Agent Maria Hill  Stellan Skarsgård as the scientist Selvig  Samuel L. Jackson as facility head Nick Fury  and Gwyneth Paltrow back as Stark's girl Friday  Pepper Potts .Overall a fine action comic book movie.,negative

Marvel's The Avengers  the culmination of the work of five movies (one of them a sequel to the first  Iron Man)  is stuffed with a good load of action and mayhem and a climax that bursts at the seams with aliens being torn apart by the heroes Captain America  Incredible Hulk  Thor and Tony Stark (plus relative newcomers Black Widow and Hawkeye  with Nick Fury and Agent Colson in the wings)  and if you want to get your money shots  Joss Whedon doesn't skimp out. But the reason why he was chosen as the filmmaker here wasn't just for name cachet (though it probably helped).What Whedon's done over much of his career in TV and other films and webseries (Buffy  Firefly  Dr. Horrible  Angel  etc) was excel at bringing groups of people together against fantastical  supernatural  other-worldly/alien forces  but making it always about stakes  humor  horror  drama and solid conflicts. Villains don't just act nasty  they have their own logic and reasons for doing what they do  and if they're not sympathetic they certainly are understandable as characters  full of the stuff that makes them great to watch  especially with the best dialog probably out of anyone (i.e. the Mayor on Buffy  for those that recall).So here we get Loki  previously a villain in Thor (and later sort of brought back for Thor 2)  and is by far the highlight of the film as Tom Hiddleston chews up scenery  but does it in a kind of elegant  theatrical  relishing way. By the time he spews out 'Muelling quim""  you're on the edge of your seat. His performance  what he does with every moment of screen time  is much more exciting than any alien snake going through the sky. And yet his ego and petty-mindedness does him in  and Whedon has a lot of fun writing this character  making him a threat but someone who can be taken down under the circumstances.This is one of the best of the Marvel films just by the way that Whedon goes about the sort of 'Ghostbusters/Ninja Turtles' formula - the four main players  each distinct  playing off one another  but things could turn on a dime any moment amid the jokes and this and that. Along with Hiddleston  Downey once again makes Tony Stark a helluva great character to take in as he is constantly thinking even as he is laying his sarcasm and deadpan on the other characters. And Johansson actually has a few really great scenes - Whedon has always written women characters as complex to the point that they put other ""complex"" male characters to shame - and somehow amid the many characters and plot turns going on  she stands out  especially Widow's scene with Loki. Ruffalo  too  does a lot with a little... until he gets to the ""other guy"".I don't know if Avengers is great art  but it does what I want to see when I go to big giant behemoth-like spectacles: provide me a host of characters who have to work together  and gives them interesting  entertaining and believable things to say. At 142 minutes it goes by at a great pace as well - not too fast  not too slow  nothing drags here  and that counts as well. Along with the first Iron Man and the recent Marvel Netflix show Daredevil  this is the MCU at the top of their game.",positive

Co-written and directed by legendary TV icon Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""  ""Angel""  and ""Firefly"")  he does not disappoint with his love of pop culture and comics as he gives the Marvel characters their justly celebrated status as the distinct characters we've grown to love growing up reading their illustrated adventures in the four-color world they inhabit. And seeing it all in 3-D is such an awesome experience! Oh  and it's great in also seeing Hawkeye  Black Widow  and Nick Fury in tow. Really  all I'll say is you must watch The Avengers. P.S. Seeing Cobie Smulders as one of the characters makes me wonder if she and her ""How I Met Your Mother"" co-star Alyson Hannigan  formerly a ""Buffy"" star  have traded stories of what it's like to work for Mr. Whedon.

Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word  superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it  and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite)  but this  Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years  with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk  the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding  by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced  intelligent and has an essence of sophistication  and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers  namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here  all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness  one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout  likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia  spunky  beautiful and sexy  and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader  without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history  and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all  a definite sci-fi classic  that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real  but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness  a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids  C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight  fiercest of a warrior class  from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star  but the mysterious Darth Vader  clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head  has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog  but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt  still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always.,positive

But as you grow up things change and on second viewing  I found this film to be surprisingly slow in places and actually comes close to outstaying its welcome towards the end. These aren't big flaws  mind you  but ones which niggle at me and make me feel as if I'm betraying a universal dream in some way. The truth is that I far prefer the second and third entries in this series  as they don't have to go through the troubles of introducing all the characters  and instead can simply continue the action at a fast speed.There are many good things about this film to make it worthwhile  though. This is one of those movies with a comic book feel to it which can appeal to adults and children alike. There's a sufficiently 'epic' nature to the film  in that a whole other universe has been created and we are merely viewing a part of what happens in it. There's plenty of action  ranging from the traditional light-saber fights to some exciting space skirmishes. The huge budget allows for many  many different special effects. Some of these look a little ropey today but they're all infinitely superior to the overblown  laughable CGI antics in THE PHANTOM MENACE  where all touch with reality was lost.The characters are likable and clear-cut; you've got heroic heroes and evil villains. Mark Hamill is fine as Luke Skywalker  although it's sad that he never achieved success in any other movies NOT in the STAR WARS series. Harrison Ford provides a clean  charismatic action man in Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is pretty and funny as Princess Leia  and Alec Guinness lends heavyweight support to the whole affair with his Obi-Wan Kenobi. The only downside to the cast are the inclusion of the robots C3P0 and R2-D2 and Chewie  who are  seen today in an adult light  pretty irritating  it has to be said. But for kids  they're funny.The villains always tend to be the best guys in these films and this is no exception. Darth Vader is THE king of cool  and I always wanted to be him when I was younger. It's strange to think how strongman Dave Prowse when from being the monster in Hammer's lame HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN to becoming one of the biggest screen villains of all time. One also mustn't forget the contribution of Peter Cushing in what was his most popular movie; he lends gravity to the movie and is excellent as the icy commander of the Death Star  mainly through his voice alone.Although this is a long film  the action is split up across a number of different planets in order to make it more interesting. There are laser battles  lots of shooting  brief gore (an arm-lopping)  and all manner of weird and wonderful rubbery alien creatures to make it enjoyable. I especially loved the scene in the garbage disposal unit which uses the old ""closing walls"" routine on our heroes to great effect. This is a deservedly famous movie which kick-started a whole new mythos  brought a legion of movie nerd fans together and harked back to the great days of the sci-fi serials of the late '30s and '40s. Not the best of the series  but pretty darned good going.",negative

Watching the film so many years later it really is amazing what George Lucas was able to do with this film and what would follow. I will gladly admit that I'm not a fanboy of this series and in fact this recent viewing was the first time I had seen this since it was released in its Special Edition form. With that said  even though I'm not a ""fanboy"" it's impossible to deny that power that this film contains.Storywise there's really nothing overly ground-breaking here but in my opinion that's what makes the film so darn good. There's no long-winded or drawn-out story to drag things down. The basic premise is rather simple as an up-and-coming fighter gets his opportunity to be great and sets out to do so. I think this simple story makes the characters stand out all the better because it really gives them a chance to shine and come to life. It certainly also helps that Lucas was clearly a fan of those cliffhangers from previous decades because he knows how to build up scenes and milk them for everything they're worth.It's really hard to say anything fresh or new about this film but watching this first one it's easy to see why people like Hamill and Fisher became iconic in these parts. Both are quite good in the film as are Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing  the two veterans of the picture. With that said  I think it goes without saying that it's Harrison Ford who really stands out in the role of Han Solo. His comic timing with Chewbacca has made for some of the most memorable moments of this film and he's simply delightful to watch in the role.Of course  fans will debate the tinkering that Lucas has done with the picture but I think both versions hold up extremely well. I understand the purist who want to view what they originally saw in theaters and I understand those who defend the updating of the effects. Either way  STAR WARS is a rare blockbuster that also manages to be extremely well-made and deserving of its reputation.",positive

Having seen articles in Time and Newsweek  my friend and I took off early from work and made our way to the one theater in the Minneapolis Metro area that was showing ""Star Wars"" (boy have times changed!).  There were local news stations  reporters  models  everywhere.   How we were able to just walk to the window and purchase tickets  I don't know  but we did. I still have my blue button with ""May the Force be With You"" emblazoned on it.  I'm told it's pretty valuable.  A reporter approached us and asked my friend  ""What do you expect.""  He responded in his sort of wise ass way  ""A sprawling intergalactic epic.""That was all very interesting  but when we finally sat down and the movie began  I found it was less than I had hoped for.  Part of my problem was that at that time  most of what I read was science fiction.  As I watched the events unfold  I realized that this movie wasn't really science fiction--it was a Western.  It was the good guy versus the bad guy and an effort to save the old ranch that the bad guys have pillaged.  Take out the awesome special effects and the cool aliens and it just wasn't very interesting.  I realize that most of the people that have seen this consider it just slightly below the second coming--nearly a religious experience--but it wasn't for me.  I saw nothing new or complex about the character or the themes in the movie.  As far as speculative science fiction it is barren. Don't get me wrong  I still think that there are amazing things to watch  but I can't get past the fact that the storm troopers can't hit the broad side of a barn with laser weapons but the good guys can pick off about a dozen from behind a post.  Where did these guys get their training?  How has the Empire survived so long with these incompetents. Having read ""Dune"" years before this film came out  I have to be brutally honest--how George Lucas didn't get sued for stealing from that book  I'll never know.  I always wondered if he made a deal with Frank Herbert.The worlds are exotic.  The aliens are wonderful (although  I thought the second and third movies were much better)  especially that bar scene. But the bottom line is that it's an adventure movie.  Maybe someday someone will convince me otherwise (I have had about 50 people try). If I'm going to watch a Western  I prefer the Earps and Doc Holliday.",positive

There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie  especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However  it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all  the acting isn't too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though  but rather of the way they were written  which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing's character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that  I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.The script is not the greatest achievement in general. It's the usual black-and-white characterization with good vs evil and the characters have no real shades  no facets. This was made up again by the strong work in other departments as it's not too memorable what they say and do  but what they look like  especially the non-human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today. I am not saying the characters are written badly. Not at all. But it's just other contributions that made them what they are today. Not the script. And while I enjoyed most of the film  I cannot see it as an epic or a cult classic as so many people do to this date. ""Star Wars"" is bound to rise again with the new film coming out soon and featuring the original cast again. It should be interesting what they make out of it. Until then  feel free to watch the old films like this one  but not too many.

R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert  but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid  he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning  Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter  who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers  he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest. They head to Mos Esley to hire a skilled pilot and they team-up with the smugglers Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Meanwhile the evil Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders to destroy the planet Alderaan to show the power of the Death Star to Leia and the rebels. Obi-Wan feels the impact in the Force and when the Millennium Falcon arrives at the destination  the group finds only debris. Further  a tractor beam pulls the spacecraft to the Death Star. What will happen to the group and Princess Leia? Will they succeed in delivering the information to the rebels?""Star Wars""  later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is the unforgettable and charming sci-fi adventure that surprised the world in 1977. The strategy of George Lucas that claimed that there was no technology available to the cinema industry in 1977 to produce the three first chapters was part of a marketing strategy that kept alive the interest of fans fro the whole six chapters  In sequence  great part of the mystery would not have raised. All the films are engaging  but none of them can beat this one rated #19 in IMDb. Harrison Ford in the top of his career and the cast show a wonderful chemistry. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Star Wars: Episódio IV – Uma Nova Esperança"" (Blu-Ray) (""Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope"")",positive

The Empire's ultimate weapon  the Death Star  is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems.  The Jedi have been destroyed  save a few living in hiding  unable to compete with the force of the Empire.  However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star.  Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape.  When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi  or Old Ben Kenobi.  Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  lets be honest  Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation.  However what it is  is a good story of good v's evil  a western of goodies v baddies set in space.  The story is simple but contains clear characters.  The thing that sets it apart is the fun  the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front.  The action scenes are mostly great  not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter  it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle.  The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars!  The effects still look good today  in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer.  Sound effects  comedy  music  it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair  blue eyes'  Chasing Amy!).  He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role.  However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting  part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas.  Ford is perfect as Han Solo  he adds character and flair to some dry performances.  Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role.  Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain  Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie  C3PO  R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'.  But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable  simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood.  Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better.,positive

Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time  I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single 'Whoa' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes  sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker  Han Solo  or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense  doesn't it? I get a kick out of the nay sayers on this board who have such a fierce guttural reaction to the success of the entire Star Wars franchise  never missing an opportunity to thrash it unmercifully. The best response to that I guess would be that they represent a mere six and a half per cent minority of the IMDb voting history for this film that give it less than a 6.0 rating. It reminds me of that joke about the one in three people who might be crazy  and your two best friends seem alright. Something to think about.Anyway  there's no point in detailing the film since virtually every one on the planet has probably seen it at least once  even my wife. My son  who was born in 1977  has probably seen it thirty times a year every year since he started watching movies  kind of a record in itself I would think  allowing him to quote virtually every line of dialog from the movie. Such is the compelling nature of true Star Wars fans  who while watching  find themselves in a galaxy far  far away.",positive

It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day  there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford  Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn't know what the film is about I'll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon  the Death Star  when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah  he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force  they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late  the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship  called the Millennium Falcon  from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there  it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once  it might not be perfect but if it wasn't for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica  the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first ""block-buster"" film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else  till one watched it you were completely out of the loop. The characters and there adventures in this and the other films in the franchise have become part of modern folklore.These comments were made based on the video released in the '80s... so no extra CGI and Greedo didn't even attempt to fire before Han killed him.",positive

Perhaps that's because by now  the special-effects look primitive but also because it's a little slow in parts  slower than the other five films. Sometimes  though  it's nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one  however  is just a bit too slow overall.The first hour of this film sets up the second hour plus the two sequels that followed in the 1980s  showing how the principal characters were united  who they are fighting against and what mystical powers they have at their disposal. Note: it was even interesting to watch this film decades later after the final installment  episode 3  was viewed. It made this first entry make a little more sense  knowing the complete story (who was related to whom  how some died  etc.). It was also a shock to go back and see the special-effects in here after viewing those final three films issued in recent years.I always got annoyed  to be honest  at two things in this initial Star Wars film I felt were overdone: the ""Rambo"" mentality in which hundreds of shots are fired at the good guys and never hit them and the constant arguing between Carrie Fisher (""Princess Leia"") and Harrison Ford (""Han Solo""). By the third film  thankfully  that bickering stopped and everyone was ""on the same page.""Despite how old this film is  it's a ""must"" for this collection since it sets up so much of what is to follow.

My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is  and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force'  but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy  whereas my girl identified with Leia  the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes  aliens  robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame themthe attention to detail and sheer creativity in design  costume  and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however  when he does get it right  he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark tooanother solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle  unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime. In fact  why not do yourself a favour: get off the internet and go watch it right now (even if you have seen it hundreds of times before).,positive

While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space  'Star Wars' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic  strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern  enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here  huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed  then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights  a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.The Star Wars movies also were responsible for jump-starting the career of Harrison Ford  and today he is probably better known for his next trilogy  as Indiana Jones. The DVDs finally came out last month  and they are near perfect  as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high  and the picture is nothing short of superb.

It wasn't the first movie to be heavily hyped. But I recall it as the first one to appeal to kids as a big adventure.In a couple ways  what's come since have ruined this. Lucas himself ruined it by deciding to make all those extra ones  making up the story as he went. And of course  every month on average we now have a new special effects movie that matches the star wars franchise in visual ambition. Many of these in fact are fueled by Lucas' several companies.So its impossible to recapture that thrill. At the time  yes we knew he stole from Kurosawa  and leaned heavily on Joseph Campbell's notions of myth. But it all seemed so fresh  and Lucas himself came across as a visionary genius. And we needed that more than we needed entertainment.Remember  the US had just been through its first sleazy republican scandal and the nation as a whole was discouraged. But the world of movies was exploding. Woody Allen gave us ""Annie Hall."" Scorcese became known. And then this. The thing that impressed us at the time was how seriously it took itself  despite how childishly goofy that intergalactic bar was. Also how powerful the sounds and images were.The mythology was so clear. We had it for decades in science fiction and fantasy novels  indeed much better. But this was the first time we had them cinematically  and cinema when it works may be the most powerful of packaged imaginations. Oh how I wish we could see it as we did then.Now we notice  for instance  how ordinary the dogfights are. These used to thrill. We don't have all the mystery that made the thing deep. Now we know who everyone is and what is going on  and it is all so much more ordinary than what we imagined at the time as possibilities.In later years  Lucas would let us down  as a person and in this saga. In fact  I think he ruined some things. But for the year of this event  he was the most celebrated singer in the choir. And by me as well.What do I mean about ruining? Things evolve. When one thing finds a niche and flourishes  it pinches off other things. When ""Birth of a Nation"" became a huge success  it froze movies as filmed plays with a larger stage instead of one of the several other directions it could have taken. Again  there was a period after talkies reinvented the medium where there was a struggle among various different directions. This you can clearly see in the period. In retrospect  it appears as if the world could have only turned out the way it did. But the trends that win aren't the best at all.So ""Star Wars"" opened up a gateway for how effects could transform cinema into something far beyond what we had before. And then it closed that gateway  so that effects now cannot show you something unfamiliar. Instead  it all has to be the familiar taken to some extreme.Yes  it was a goose at the time. But Star Wars killed the greater possibilities of science fiction. In film  at least  and because books are inherently cinematic now  in books too.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",positive

An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers  and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker  scoundrel Captain Han Solo  and a couple of quirky droids  Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy  and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy  weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents  I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously  where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented  Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones  I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis  while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands  but really do those things matter? No they do not  because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema  something of a portal to youngsters such as I  it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here)  it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach  and crucially  above all else  it got film goers hungry again  a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton  in fact most pale into comparison on impact value  but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes)  Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history  George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time  but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology  he didn't just make a movie  he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series  is how it has become part of modern day pop culture  anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately  though  it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great  it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre  now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend  a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10",positive

I remember when it was released in 1977 everyone was going bannanas as to how good it was . I finally managed to see it when it was broadcast on television in 1982 and was very disappointed with what I saw   okay it was entertaining to a certain degree but I didn`t believe for one moment it deserved the hype or massive audience figures . One other thing that sprung to my mind many years later is that it`s unoriginal!!!! SPOILERS TO THIS AND LOTR !!!!I can`t help thinking that Obi Wan Kenobi has been based on Gandalf from LORD OF THE RINGS . They`re both wise old men   they both "" die "" a heroic death and both come come back as etheral beings in the trilogy and both are played in the films by Knights of the stage. However whereas Ian Mckellan gives an outstanding performance as Gandalf Alec Guinness has little impact as Obi Wan . I do not say this lightly as I rate Guinness as the greatest actor of the 20th century . In fact as one reviewer has already pointed out none of the actors give much of a performance except Harrison Ford who is the only member of the cast who went onto become a household name . Compare the performances of the cast of the LOTR trilogy who could all easily pass as Knights of the stageI`m not saying this is a bad movie - it`s not . It is entertaining and does have a sense of humour and the costume design is excellent especially the stormtrooper uniforms but what I`m saying is it`s not a great one either and certainly doesn`t deserve to be in the IMDB top ten movies .

I feared it wouldn't be my thing  but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor  while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at  with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding  epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated  and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising  the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat  but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever  the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke  and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued  but he is still terrific  and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious  and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain  especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all  a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox,positive

He basically took a ""B"" movie idea  something you'd see at a Saturday matinée and made it into a high-quality picture. This sequel had Lucas turning the directing duties over to Irvin Kershner and the end result certainly raises it to an ""A"" movie and one that many fans believe is the greatest of the series. I'm not going to lie  I somewhat enjoy the original a tad bit more but that's not to say this is a bad movie. Far from that.What's rather amazing is the fact that the producers  director and screenwriters simply could have given us the same film again but instead they decided to make it much bigger  more darker and I'd argue they really wanted to blow the original out of the water. The film once again benefits from some terrific special effects  a rousing score from John Williams and there's no question that visually the film is a lot more impressive than the original.You've also got the cast back together with both Hamill and Fisher once again delivering the goods but also Billy Dee Williams and Alec Guinness in a bit part. Once again it's Harrison Ford who easily steals the film with his comic timing and just that hero persona that shines through. Plus  it's just magic seeing him and Chewbacca work together.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made and it's hard to argue with that.",positive

It was directed by Irvin Kershner over 35 years ago and had some success with the Academy Awards  even if not nearly as much as the first film. And I myself must say that I found it not better than the first (even if the IMDb rating says so)  but also not much worse. Once again  it delivers especially on the visual side in terms of sets  cinematography and special effects while coming a bit short in terms of the story. The characters are all fairly memorable though  the humans and the others. There are many many characters that appeared in the first film already  for example Obi Wan Kenobi is even back for one scene  but there are also some interesting new additions  most of all the uber-famous Yoda. And Darth Vader is the main villain in here while being just one of several villains in the first film. A great light saber sequence is included here too.I said that I was not too overwhelmed by the story and that implies the plot as a whole  but also minor scenes and references. One example would be Calrissian's character obviously being totally scared of Vader for almost the entire film and then  completely out of nowhere  he suddenly has no fear anymore and joins the resistance fighters. Not very realistic character development. I also did not like the references in terms of mathematical probability early on. This makes it look really unrealistic that Skywalker survived or that Han Solo managed to control the spacecraft some time later.All in all  it was an okay watch at best and the film has several lengths  starts off nicely with the snow planet scenes  gets worse  but gains some momentum again towards the end. However  I believe that they could have done without roughly 20 minutes and kept this movie at 105 minutes instead of over two hours. You have to be very generous to appreciate this film as a whole as there were more than just a few weaknesses to it. Still  the good moments make somewhat up for it  even if the film never reached real greatness. Not once. Nonetheless  I will be generous and give it a cautious thumbs-up  especially for science fiction fans  which I am probably not really.",positive

While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat  Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda.  However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series.  However what gets added to that is a much darker strand.  The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact.  This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion.  In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company.  The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett.  The two work well together and come together well for a great finale.  The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first.  The strong characters from the first (Han  C3P0 et al) are all still good here.  However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi.  Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past  a revelation then  but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart  but the darker nature of the film makes it much better.  Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is  as the title suggests  the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising.  All the music  characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date.,positive

Yeah OK  he's a puppet  but the character of Yoda is like the Spock of the SW universe  a stabilizing force (Force?) who helps Luke remain grounded and in control of his emotions.I recall some disappointment the first time I saw this film during it's original theatrical release relative to the Han Solo cliffhanger  somehow I felt it took away from the structure I was looking for in the chapter following the original ""Star Wars"". Viewing it today I don't feel the same way. It dealt a momentary reprieve to the Han/Leia romance and allowed for analysis of the Darth/Luke relationship. Vader's attempt to shield his son from the Emperor by promising a turn to the Dark Side was ingeniously turned on it's head with Vader suggesting young Skywalker use his power to defeat the Emperor. The scene was cleverly done and Luke's response hinted at things to come in ""Return Of The Jedi"".My most recent viewing of this episode was only the third time since the original theatrical release  and I find that it hasn't lost any of it's impact  maintaining a vitality and excitement that time hasn't diminished. Watching the remastered DVD version  particularly with the sub titles  offers an entirely new perspective when you can pause and rewind to understand better what certain characters said. Perhaps that's why I found it a lot easier to keep track of the fine points of the story  place names like Hoth  Yavin and Bespin  and secondary characters like Governor Tarkin. All those subtle points add a more defined structure to the story  and helps one appreciate much more the intricacy of the universe created by George Lucas.",negative

""A long time ago  in a galaxy far  far away"" on the ice world of Hoth  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is investigating possible Empire activity  only to be attacked by a snow monster. He manages to escape with the help of the Force and his light sabre  but he is still stuck in the blizzard  and before going unconscious and being rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford)  he sees a vision of Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Degobah system and find Jedi master Yoda. So after a quick battle between the Rebels and the Empire  Luke  with R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) heads to this planet  and eventually he finds Yoda (a Muppet style creature voiced and performed by Muppet member Frank Oz  aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear)  and they start training. Meanwhile  Han  Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher)  Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are in the Millennium Falcon  pursued by the Empire (because of a tracking device)  and hide for a while in what they thought was the inside of a near meteor  but it was in fact the belly of a giant worm alien. When they do get out  they head for their destination to fix the ship  the planet Bespin  where they are greeted by Han's old shifty gambler friend (and original Millennium Falcon owner)  Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). But what they didn't know is that Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse  voiced by James Earl Jones) and the stormtroopers arrived before them  and they are the bait of Vader's trap to get Luke  who he has become obsessed with finding. As a prize for finding them  Han Solo is frozen in carbonate and (when confirmed he is alive) is give to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt (who you saw in the first film). Eventually  Luke does land on the planet  and he and Darth have a long and exciting light sabre fight  while Leih's gang escape in the Millennium Falcon. The pinnacle twist and great quote of the film is  after cutting Luke's hand off  Darth Vader revealing the truth about his father's death  he says ""I am your father!"" After this he is eventually rescued  has his hand replaced  and Lando and Chewbacca fly away in the Millennium Falcon  a more more obvious 'to be continued' moment.

I was not disappointed. The action started almost immediately and keeps up throughout the film till the climactic light sabre battle. We are also introduced to the new interesting characters Yoda  Lando and the Emperor himself.As the film begins the rebels are on the run  hiding on the barren ice planet of Hoth and the empire is dispatching droids to search the galaxy for them. One lands not far from Luke and he sets off to investigate but before he can get far he is attacked by a yeti-like creature which drags him off to an ice cave. Luke manages to escape but it is too late for him to get back to the base and it looks like he might freeze to death. Luckily for him Han is out searching for him and eventually finds him just after he has a vision of his old friend Obi-Wan Kenobi who tells him to seek a Jedi master called Yoda on the planet Dagobah. Once back at the base the soon learn that the Empire has discovered where they are and start to evacuate. While this is occurring they must hold off an attack by imperial walkers which are attempting to destroy the shield protecting the base. Eventually the base falls but not before our heroes can escape.At this point the action splits  Luke and R2 fly to Dagobah and Han  Chewie  Princess Leah and C3PO flee in the Millennium Falcon. When Luke arrives on Dagobah he discovers the planet is one huge swamp into which his X-wing sinks. He and R2 soon find a strange creature who says that he can take them to Yoda  of course it turns out that he is Yoda  after some persuasion he begins to train Luke. Meanwhile back on the Falcon things aren't going according to plan; when ambushed by imperial star destroyers they discover that the hyper-drive isn't working so must hide in a dangerous asteroid field. Flying into cave on one of the larger asteroids the attacked by strange creatures that feed on the ships power cables  when they go outside to remove them they discover that the cave itself isn't what they thought it to be so must flee once more into the path of the imperial forces. Being a crafty pilot Han manages to escape from them but is pursued by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.Needing repairs they head to Cloud City in the nearby Bespin system. Here they are met by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian who offers to help them. Unfortunately for them Darth Vader got there sooner and made a deal with Lando. Meanwhile Luke has a vision that his friends are in danger and ends his training early to go and help  despite Yoda's warning that he is at risk from the dark side of the force and could make things worse. When he gets there he confronts Vader who tells him something that goes against everything he thought to be true... in the very unlikely event that you don't know already I'll avoid spoiling it.Like the original film this is full of excellent special effects but isn't swamped with excessive CGI like the more recent prequels. The acting and direction are both pretty good. Being the middle act of the original trilogy it is much darker in tone than the first film and the ending can hardly be called happy. I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody regardless of their age  it is one of the few sequels to improve on the first film of its series.,positive

There is a much more polished look to this one  and improved sound In fact  the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.While the first Star Wars was a bit subdued  this one picks up the action right from the start  although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out  and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer's interest with other things.The second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved  and ""Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.Some of the movie's dialog is still corny  especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship  but it's not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from ""Chewbacca "" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The ""Rambo"" action continues as it did in the first film  with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous  but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film  overall  delivers another interesting adventure  far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one  which was even better.",positive

Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas  Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star  and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim  meanwhile  is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight  whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth  a chase scene through an asteroid field  and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel)  and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father  it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series.

Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker  being educated by mystical Yoda and facing off against Darth Vader  who reveals an unanticipated secret. Irvin Kershner's direction is thoughtful--he brings to the action sequences a deep undercurrent of purpose--but he's also mechanical  perhaps spending too much time with Luke (who  due to a car accident suffered in real-life by Hamill  has a perplexed  dour appearance). Harrison Ford provides lots of old-fashioned charm  the special effects and music are wonderful  but the cliffhanger finale wasn't really fair (at the time  it felt like a slap in the face).

Star Wars installment  might be the best of the bunch.,2004-10-07,My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space  the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic  strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern  enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here  huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed  then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights  a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy  because the first one  in this case 'Star Wars'  starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However  an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement  and grabs your imagination than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month  and they are near perfect  as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high  and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars  Empire Strikes Back  and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are  and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.,positive

The original ""Star Wars"" was a success in my opinion because it had three things:  a collection of images from other films  distinctly referencing them. Some were film- schoolish like the Kurosawa quotes. But most were like what Kurosawa himself referenced: already deeply embedded visual touchstones  not having lost their power in becoming clichés. These were collected in one large form  the Flash Gordan form let's call it  which all of us slightly knew. It could be recalled with enough familiarity to register but not enough to set expectations  so Lucas could fill the bucket with whatever he found and liked. a notion of a complete  understandable cosmology. Its the noir notion that laws of the universe exist and cannot be seen  and if they could they wouldn't be comprehensible. This notion is deep in film  so deep that when a movie comes along that posits a cosmology that is whole  and revealable  it shocks. What that movie did was give us enough of a glimpse into this to believe that we could understand the world  at least THIS world of the ""galaxy far away."" Remember when that original came out? The images were impressible  but what people talked about wasn't what they saw  but about how the world worked. It settled first in an ersatz religion among geeky kids and now has been swallowed by the ""simple"" US religions  and its presidential representative. the notion of a quest. Its an old form  but cast in the above noted situation  it takes new power. The traditional form  the Goethe-Lytton form was there to remind and reveal mysteries. Here it is clearer  to explain. There was a lowbrow professor at the time of a women's college that a TeeVee interviewer made popular. It was sort of a metaquest. This simple man said that we could actually understand the nature of trying to understand nature. It was a lucky break for Lucas  because it meshed with this shocking notion of a grand cosmology that we know our hero (check out the name: ""sky walker"") will grasp  master and show us.That was the first film. A huge success  just huge. It did change many things  but from my perspective the key thing was how it reset that great American invention of noir  as important as jazz  and liberty which form a sort of trilogy of contradictory  three-way tension.Okay. Now the second big Ted idea  the necessity for the equal size of steps in abstraction when you have two steps. It seems this is hardwired in the brain  a sort of human quantum mechanics. If you look back along the abstraction  say a cartoon in a cartoon  the distance between the two will be precisely the same as the surrounding cartoon.So  when they made the second Star Wars movie  they could reference the previous one in the way that it referenced its cinematic background. It had a writer in Kasden who knew how to do this. And it had a director in Lucas' film school teacher who did also. Neither had a huge hit other than this because it was such a cool setup  having such a thing to build on.You'll read lots about trying to humanize  and how faces were used. But all that is simply in the service of abstracting closer to us from the original  in equal portion. This is the son. Why did the franchise fail after this? Because there was no step left to abstract to and maintain the brand.(This comment is a replacement of one deleted for unknown reasons. This was requested by a reader.)Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",positive

But Luke gets a calling to the planet Dagobah  where under the tutelage of Jedi Master  Yoda  he hopes to become a Jedi himself  but that also brings him closer to his  and Leia's  destiny.Lets tell it as it is  The Empire Strikes Back is a better film than Star Wars  not as impacting of course  but most definitely better. Technically  in story telling and in tone  it holds up well today and certainly warrants the amount of times it crops up in best sequels debates. That it's not actually a sequel is irrelevant  it is of course the filler in a wonderful sci-fi sandwich  because as second instalments go  Empire has few peers. With Empire Strikes Back we get all the whizz bang adventure strewn heart of Star Wars  but George Lucas (stepping aside for Irvin Kershner to direct) has also fleshed the story out with a serious dark tone that oddly becomes a bedfellow to the romantic fun on offer  where new and engaging characters (and creatures) add spice to this wonderful fantastical broth.Aided by the considerable writing talent of Leigh Brackett (The Long Goodbye  Rio Bravo  The Big Sleep)  Lucas took the bold and ingenious step of giving the bad guys the upper hand  in fact it could be argued that he was taking a considerable risk with his ending. Forcing his viewers to wait for the final chapter (three years later)  after tantalisingly setting us up with a corker of plot twist (one which is still to this day as potent as it was back on release)  Lucas pulled perhaps one of the cheekiest carrot dangles in cinema history.Though more famed for its dark undertones  Empire is for sure still a very fun movie  C3PO goes into camp overdrive and Han Solo ups his quip quota by some margin. Then of course there is Yoda  in himself a comedic joy. The action sequences beg for repeat viewings  a battle on the ice laden planet Hoth is a marvel and the choreography for Skywalker's fight with Darth Vader is out of the top draw. But ultimately it's with the dark side that the picture excels. Complex and amazingly posing moral quandary's  The Empire Strikes Back is quite an experience  one that will forever hold up to repeat viewings for this particular viewer. 10/10,positive

Some people may be surprised that Mark Hamill's career as a movie star didn't take off but one wonders why he was cast in the franchise in the first place since he makes a rather wet unlikely hero rather than the youthful everyman the role is written as . Watching Hamill try and carry his scenes shows how unimpressive he is and how good the rest of the cast are in comparison THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a good Summer blockbuster but the brutal truth is that it's no more than that . It was made in an era before CGI dominated spectacular FX driven films at the turn of the century and that alone makes it worth seeing even if the most impressive scenes happen in the first half .

It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes  and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy  letting his emotions get the better of him.With the directing chores being handed over to Irvin Kershner (""A Fine Madness""  ""Up the Sandbox""  ""Eyes of Laura Mars"")  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" marks a maturation in terms of story quality  as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. After all  as it begins  it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. It's never treated as a given that Good will prevail. The screenplay is credited to Leigh Brackett (""The Big Sleep""  ""Rio Bravo""  ""El Dorado"") and Lawrence Kasdan (""Raiders of the Lost Ark""  ""Body Heat""  ""The Big Chill"")  and stars Harrison Ford  Mark Hamill  and Carrie Fisher make the most of the material. The endearing Yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. The film is a little short on cool aliens  but it does feature a Yeti-like monster called a Wampa  and an enormous slug used in a funny ""worm in the apple"" sort of gag. The spectacle is fantastic  but it never overwhelms the story. The early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet Hoth is incredibly well executed  and the final lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another.The special effects are as impressive as ever  and it would be difficult to hear that memorable John Williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. You truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them. And it delivers an ending that perfectly captures a sense of uncertainty and a degree of despair  setting up the problems to be solved in the next film.This is definitely a milestone blockbuster that holds up well 33 years later.10 out of 10.",positive

Because this film has been reviewed so many times and I am so late in seeing it  I will make review VERY quick  as there isn't a whole lot more I can say that hasn't already been said.Although I have almost 10000 reviews to my credit (making me a real nut-case!)  I rarely ever see blockbuster films. Heck  I've never seen ""Jurassic Park"" and I mostly only go to theaters to see movies my daughters want to see or the Oscar-nominated shorts that are shown each winter. So the fact that I never saw ""Avatar"" in the theaters isn't very surprising. Any why  then  did I see the film? Well  Netflix (or more likely the Post Office) made a mistake!! I was supposed to watch an Ealing Studios comedy (just the sort of thing a film snob would adore) but the package was ripped open--and ""Avatar"" was inside! While I should have seen it in 3-D on a huge screen  I fortunately at least saw it on a 58"" TV---the best I could hope for instead of the theater. In fact  I would say that if you only have a small TV  don't even bother as the graphics are the big reason to see the film--not the story. Additionally  James Cameron achieved something never achieved before (and hopefully which can now be achieved again thanks to CGI)--he's made sci-fi no longer the realm of humans or human-like beings. So much of the world in this film is 100% alien--something common in books but NEVER on TV or in films. Because of these factors  the film MUST be seen--even if the story  unfortunately  is a bit simplistic with its 'people are stupid and lack TRUE insight' plot. I would have liked the aliens teaching the humans much (like they did in the film) but less of the 'noble savage' idea that people have nothing to offer in exchange. While I do agree people are sometimes stupid  it just seemed a bit too black & white in its thinking and  as a result  lacks depth when it comes to the otherwise fascinating story. For example  the boss-man in charge of the operation comes off as a walking stereotype--like G.I. Joe on steroids and not a real person.Excellent...but flawed. Next time (and the director has announced there will be at least two follow-up films)  I sure hope they spend some more of the one hundred bazillion dollar budget on better writing--as the characters were too often one-dimensional and the macho fight at the end just seemed...well...stupid and clichéd. More well-rounded and real and I would have given this film a 10--perhaps the next ones will earn this distinction.",positive

To me it felt like a visual feast if little else. Re-watching it again  I found more strengths  but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece.Starting with Avatar's strengths  it is absolutely mind-blowing visually. The cinematography  landscapes  scenery  colours  make-up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar's strongest asset. I also liked the score  it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard  but it had some very nice moments  while Cameron's direction is competent  the message admirable  and the finale well and truly explosive. I also loved the flying sequences  they were breathtaking.The acting in general is a mixed bag. Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead  while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited. Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over-the-top villain of the piece too  however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so-so  doesn't help really her character isn't that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren't given very much to do.What didn't work so well is that Avatar's story  with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment  is rather simplistic and predictable. I also felt it took a while to get going  and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side. And is it me  or does this film drag at times  particularly towards the end? Now don't get me wrong  I liked the concept  it wasn't exactly original  as I often heard it described as ""Dances with Wolves in Space with rip-offs of Pocahontas and FernGully""- but I am not going to join those who say that- I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me. Then there is the dialogue  which is nothing special and never quite rings true. There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy. The characters also came across as rather clichéd  especially Giovanni Ribisi's  and the character development was lacking.So all in all  Avatar does have a lot of strengths  but a lot of weaknesses too. I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker  which to be honest left me cold  but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5-star masterpiece. 6/10 Bethany Cox",negative

Such praise invariably leaves me cold  which is why I finally caught up with this film not in the cinema but on television during its debut showing. I was in no hurry.My thoughts? AVATAR is a decent film  yes  and one that's highly entertaining – but it's no masterpiece. Cameron works hard and puts in a great deal of effort as director  but it doesn't come close to the strength and power of his earlier one-two pairing  THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS. AVATAR is a film that works on a superficial level as long as you don't think about it too much  and the overly familiar storyline has already been done before in the likes of DANCES WITH WOLVES. Except Cameron had the clever idea of transporting the action to an alien planet and hoping nobody would notice. And you know what? It seems nobody – or very few people - actually did.Does the somewhat slim storyline justify the rather excessive running time? I'm not entirely sure it does. The beginning feels a little slow and the whole fish-out-of-water premise involving the central character's induction to the alien society is rather familiar. Much of the film just seems like an excuse to show off the CGI effects  which are admittedly impressive although not quite as lifelike as Cameron would have you believe. I'd still have preferred them to use unadulterated human actors for the aliens  rather than converting the performances by the actors into pure CGI  but then you can't have anything.As is usual with Cameron  the film is more about the technology and the science rather than the characters. The actors don't make a great deal of impact  it has to be said; the dull Sam Worthington made his name with this and TERMINATOR: SALVATION  two films which barely require him to act. Still  Sigourney Weaver is on hand to show him how it's done  and Stephen Lang makes a great villain  as always (I still remember him from the likes of Steven Seagal actioner FIRE DOWN BELOW in the '90s  and I guess it took a while for everyone else to catch up). It's hard to assess the performers playing the aliens because the effects are just too distracting.At its heart  AVATAR is a simple and straightforward action film  offering the kind of breakneck  breathtaking effects-infused sequences that highlighted TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. It's admittedly beautiful to watch  particularly the alien landscapes brought stunningly to life and the various creatures that inhabit them. The action is engaging  particularly the extensive climax in which the speed picks up a gear and Cameron really lets loose with all kinds of pyrotechnic mayhem. The climax  which seems to run for about forty minutes  displays a willingness to dispatch important characters in a realistic and gritty way  really ending the movie on a high and leaving the viewer with a good impression. It may be familiar – too much so in places – but as a piece of spectacle  AVATAR ticks all the right boxes.,positive

Once there he has orders to learn their way of life so that the military can eventually throw them off their land but soon the marine begins to feel that the Pandora way of life is the way to be. Okay  I'll admit that I was very skeptical going into this movie after hearings months worth of buzz saying this film was going to change the way we view movies. I became even more skeptical after it became a hit and just recently became the most successful film in history. This type of movie normally isn't my cup of tea but I was left amazed countless times and in the end I have to admit that Cameron has done it again. There are only a handful of films that actually change the ways movies are made. We can look at 1915's THE BIRTH OF A NATION as one. GONE WITH THE WIND would be another. I have no doubt in my mind that AVATAR is another film in line with those two classics and I'm sure one day people will study this movie just as we have studied those other two for decades now. I'm not a fan of CGI but what we have here is something truly amazing because it doesn't look like something fake nor does it seem like a phony marketing device. As the movie goes along Cameron does such a masterful job at building this alternate life that one really begins to forget that they're watching a movie. I've heard stories of people becoming depressed after watching this movie when they realize that Pandora isn't real and I understand how some could feel this way. While watching the movie there wasn't a single second where the idea of me watching something fake entered my mind. The characters  their wildlife  the forest and all the creates in that forest were extremely real to me and the way Cameron brings all of this to life constantly had my jaw on the floor and my eyes bugged out. I honestly don't think I blinked once during this film because I was worried about missing something that I hadn't seen before. The amazing neon colors of the flowers or the look of the glowing eyes  no matter what you're looking at on the screen you can't help but feel as if you're seeing something for the first time and it's unlike anything you've seen before. This alternate lifestyle or universe that Cameron has created is something truly breathtaking and something you want to take it as much as you can.The 3-D effects are also masterfully done because Cameron doesn't just sit there and throw things out you. With only a couple exceptions  the 3-D is only used to put you into this universe and I must admit that I've never seen 3-D like this and I can only hope more movies will use it to this effect. The 160-minute running time flashes by without any slow spots and the performances are all top-notch with Worthington  Zoe Saldana  Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang really delivering the goods. The music score by James Horner is epic and Mauro Fiore's cinematography really puts you in the center of all the action. Many have complained that the story is pretty unoriginal and light  which might be true but it really doesn't take away from the film as it's still good enough to keep you interested in the characters  their actions and everything they're feeling. Walking out of this movie I really did feel like what those in 1915 would have felt coming out of THE BIRTH OF A NATION. I felt as if I had seen something not only epic but groundbreaking and the start of something new in cinema history. Perhaps Kubrick's 2001 also made people feel this way. Either way  a lot of credit has to go to Cameron who has once again delivered something truly special.,positive

When his brother is killed  he is offered an opportunity to take his place on the faraway planet Pandora. The company is mining valuable unobtanium and they are encroaching the local aliens Na'vi. Avatars are genetically engineered alien look-alike with both alien genes and human genes. Jake is similar enough to his brother to take over his Avatar. Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) leads a team to connect with the natives and find a diplomatic solution. As he gets to know the locals  it becomes harder to bridge the divide.The story is not as impressive. This is simplistic native warriors against big bad corporate land rapers. While the visuals are amazing  this is a long winded version of other movies like 'Dances with Wolves'. The big drawback for me is Sam Worthington. While the technology is there to give the avatars emotions  Sam isn't a good enough actor to take full advantage.This is one of the first motion captured performance that actually looks natural. The amount of CGI is impressive. The amount of skills and technology involved to put this movie together is a big step forward. Compared to the stuff that Robert Zemeckis does  the big difference is the faces. James Cameron brings real emotions to his CGI characters that is still missing from Zemeckis. The world of Pandora looks amazing and lush. It has enough fantasy and realism. It represented a new high point of 3D. It is a visual triumph.,positive

I am tired of special effects  but this has soul. Do the people that don't like the story resent the environmental vs. military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race  a new language  and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God's sake. This is full of spectacle  ""humanity "" and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I'm surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren't complaining. Yes  there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain  and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body  a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren't as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still  while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater  I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format. I think it might be a bit more liberating.",negative

He dominated the awards season over a decade earlier with ""Titanic"" already and things looked similar back in 2010 when only ""The Hurt Locker"" managed to keep ""Avatar"" from winning all the very big prizes. Ironically enough  the former was made by Cameron's ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow which made for some interesting references (and bad jokes) at the Oscars back then. But still ""Avatar"" won three trophies at the Oscars alone and many many more during other big awards ceremonies. There are several versions out there of this film when it comes to the runtime and the longest is probably the director's cut that comes incredibly close to the massive 3-hour mark. Your choice if you want to go for this one or the original theatrical release for example. You can decide it perhaps if you plan on rewatching this extremely long and extremely blue movie before the sequels come out as it seems Cameron still wants to follow through with his plan of releasing no less than four sequels to ""Avatar"" until 2025 that he has worked on in the last decade.The cast includes Sam Worthington who is the lead actor here and it is definitely the by far biggest work of his career. Add to that Cameron's longtime collaborator Sigourney Weaver and relatively young actors like Giovanni Ribisi  Michelle Rodriguez or Zoe Saldana. The main antagonist is played by Stephen Lang who  as usual  elevates the material. Oh yeah  CCH Pounder is on board too and deserves the mention for sure. Basically  there are two kinds of people when it comes to ""Avatar""  those who really absolutely love the movie and think it is a revelation and then those who think it is all pretense and nothing special at all. So it sure is a clash of extremes and I personally would say they are both in the wrong. The right approach is somewhere in-between. ""Avatar"" is a movie that is breathtakingly beautiful on many occasions and that offers a solid story that is nothing too great though. But it also offers basically fight and war sequences for 45 minutes or so  basically the entire last third of the movie. And this is where the film somehow lost me to be honest. It is just too long for basically nothing but action scenes  even if lots of important stuff (deaths mostly) happens during that time.As for the film's frequently discussed environmental message  I am a bit undecided. I think the general concept of showing how humans (or Na'vi) should live in peace with nature and all its creatures  plants and animals  is a honorable one  but it is also pretty simple because you could wonder the extent to which the taming  i.e. the violent submission  works against this principle for example. But you could write pages on this subject to be honest  alone about this movie  and at times I must say I think it takes itself more seriously than it should given the substance it has and messages it is sending. I read frequently that people compare this film to ""Pocahontas""  but it's been so long that I have seen the latter (Have I at all?)  so I cannot really elaborate on the subject. I think ""Avatar"" offers enough to enjoy the movie as its own creative achievement and even if it has sequences during which it drags a bit  it is still very much worth watching  preferably on the big screen. If you have a chance to do so (again)  then don't miss out.To everybody who hasn't seen ""Avatar"" yet (if there are actually people out there that fit this description)  maybe wait until the new films come out and then I am sure many cinemas will show this original film before and you can watch it there and then decide if you are interested in more. This is (as almost always with Cameron) by no means an actors' movie  even if some have baity material. It is really all about the messages and the world and the environment in this movie. All about the visual side basically. A whole new world. Maybe not a whole new movie as there are considerable weaknesses in here without a doubt. One of the better  but not very best films of 2009 I would say  one that deserves neither all the hate nor all the praise it's been getting. And for closure  let me say that the song during the closing credits is also pretty amazing to listen to.",positive

Another case of ""Uh oh  there goes the neighborhood"". The dreaded earthling  apparently already having destroyed their own planet  settles on what appears to be the moon of a huge planet called Pandora  and decides to take over. The best way to interact with the residents of this colorful planet is something called an avatar  or fake body in which the soul of an earthling is suddenly put into the avatar  a proxy of what the residents of this place looks like. The avatars interact with the residents  feel everything they do  but when the day is over and the human soul wakes up  the avatar simply passes out as their soul has been removed. Then a ruthless marine commander decides that the residents of this planet need to move from where they are  and the scientist (Sigourney Weaver) running the avatar program objects  leading her and a crippled marine (Sam Worthington) to steal one of the marines' aircraft to warn the natives and prevent the nasty Stephen Lang  the colonel who has no regards for the residents  the native American like Na'vi  turning this into a modern science fiction version of many classic westerns.This takes time to build  but once Worthington is in his avatar body  the action really takes off  especially after he meets Na'vi princess Zoe Saldana. The strong Saldana  seeing Worthington as a ""baby""  educates him after her parents  the clan and spiritual leaders of the tribe  insist that he is now one of them. Of course  Saldana already has an admirer  promised as her mate  and this sets up potential rivalry. But as Lang's anger towards the betrayal of Weaver  Worthington and the few who followed them out grows  so does the violence  and it's up to this small group of avatars to warn the tribe to get out before its too late  because the power of Lang's weapons of mass destruction knows no barriers. As I am not a huge fan of modern CGI or the loud special effects that have overtaken modern cinema  I have avoided many films like this over the past decade  but on home video  find you can easily control the volume rather than be blasted by theater speakers. I instantly recognized the plot structure from many films over the years  but was impressed by the colorful photography and human way the natives were presented  instantly correlating it with real earth native American tribes  so often abused and misunderstood in Hollywood movies. The script is indeed better than I expected  and I was grabbed emotionally nearly from the start. Like other blockbuster franchises  I suspect that future entries in this film series will not nearly be as powerfully ingrained on my memory  and I hope that the time is taken to write great stories with great scripts that won't rely on old tricks and thus become a pale imitation of this film which for future generations should be seen on a large screen to get the full impact  something I missed.",positive

Jake had decided to take the place of his twin brother after his death in a robbery  and use his expensive Avatar  a sort of surrogate of the Omaticaya tribe that is embodied through the transference of the human conscience. In the facility  Jake meets the greedy representative of the powerful corporation Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) that expects to expel the Na'vi from their lands that to mine the wealthy ore underground. Jake is approached by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) that asks him to learn the habits and culture of the Na'vi and to send a daily report to him; in exchange  he would get an expensive spine surgery for him to walk again. Jake meets the leery Neytiri (Zoe Saldana)  the daughter of the chief of the Na'vi  in the forest and little by little Jake forms close ties with the natives and falls in love for Neytiri. When Colonel Quaritch collects enough information about the Na'vi  he decides to use the force to drive them out of their lands.I have just watched ""Avatar"" on DVD and the question that is drumming into my head is how can this film have not wined the Oscar 2010 of best motion picture of the year? The weak ""The Hurt Locker"" in Brazil was released straight to video while ""Avatar"" has been in the movie theaters for months (and still is). And both are about the external diplomatic policy of bombing to take (in Iraq and in the metaphoric Pandora - who was entrusted with a box where all the evils of human life are kept) but with different conclusions  since Eywa has a different attitude and helps the worshipers. Now I can understand the deserved hype surrounding ""Avatar"" that won three (3) Oscars and another twenty-eight (28) awards and had fifty- three (53) nominations. The original ecological and mystical story is fascinating with wonderful visual conception. As highlighted by another user  ""Avatar must be seen and cannot be described"". The Canadian James Cameron has really written and directed an outstanding feature. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Avatar""On 08 January 2011  I saw ""Avatar"" again  now on Blu-Ray.",positive

It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point. Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories.If we ignore the 3D for a minute  the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D. The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative (ironic since how dumb the name of it is) and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them. Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na'vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally – it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping/swinging special effect begin. There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was  only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I'm seeing is entirely virtual. OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and  in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless.In 3D it doesn't quite hit the same mark for me. The ""look it's in 3D"" shots are not as obvious as some of the other films (where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason) but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn't aid the scene. Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great – the money is all there to be seen. Thing is  the reason I was able to think about ""how did they do that shot"" while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with. The plot is basic and obvious – others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people  so I'll not add to that debate. The problem for me is simpler than that  it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak. My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as ""Unobtainium"" and there were plenty of things like this. The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn't ring true. Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever.The cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects (see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen). Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar. Saldana's performance is good  again despite some of her expressions and dialogue. Weaver is ""so-so""  Moore is pointless  Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clichéd that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was. I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well. Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn't add a terrible lot. Voice work from Studi  Pounder and others is good.Overall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone. In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue. That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these.",positive

It's a fact that it has broken all the records (except at the Oscars  which might have saved us a King of the World/Universe speech by Mr. Cameron)  that it's loved by many  but despised by quite a lot also. While the story is not Original (it's not like there are that many Original stories lying around waiting to be made)  the technical achievements have to be seen! Yes the story seems to be just another take on the Pocahontas story  but does that make the movie itself bad from the get go? I don't think so. After watching it a second time (at the theaters)  I have to say  that there are quite a few nuances to the story  that are quite nice. Two lines from the beginning are kind of setting the tone  which you only realize when you watch it a second time.The 3-D Effects are great  but subtle and it was no surprise that they won at this years Academy Awards. While I still felt that the Navi ""people"" didn't feel entirely realistic  it didn't feel wrong either. The graphics fitted into the whole Fantasy vibe the movie had going for it (at least that's how I felt  when I watched it). They weren't photo-realistic  but they were good enough.If you like a movie to be more low key  you should check ""Battle for Terra""  an animated Feature  that has a similar overall story and came out prior to Avatar and therefor shouldn't be judged by a technical viewpoint/comparison to Avatar. That being said  I hope a future Blu Ray (DVD) Release of the movie will revolutionize the TV market and if we are lucky enough  the extended cut of the movie  might surface at the cinemas at/near the end of 2010. I'm looking forward to that  although I'm a bit skeptical about the love scene  that is apparently going to make it into that cut ...Edit: Looks like we have been ""lucky"" enough ... though I would argue with that myself now. After having watched the movie for a third time (the last one being the extended cinema cut)  I kinda began to dread the experience. It's just too much for me. Even on the IMAX screen in London and even while recognizing many (most?) of the new inserted scenes. And there is even a bigger cut out on DVD/Blu Ray. Though the 3-D version will not be released before 2011. I personally can't watch it again for another 2 years ... or else I would have to re-evaluate and cut off a point or two ...",positive

Not that I couldn't have waited  but the opportunity presented itself  and I was already inclined to see it based on some of the positive stuff I've read about the film and James Cameron's ten year mission to 'get it done right'.The results for me are mixed. Going on the basis of technical wizardry  CGI effects and brilliant use of color  the film scores high. But when you get right down to it  the story is entirely derivative of themes that have been done numerous times before. Without exaggeration  virtually every movie Western ever made had at it's core a similar plot line - whether it be a battle over land rights  water rights  gold mines  or the inevitable clash of ranchers versus open range cattlemen. Chalk this one up to the all inclusive mineral rights category. With energy supplies back on Earth entirely depleted  the planet Pandora offers a rare commodity valued at twenty million dollars a pound. It's called unobtanium. Unobtanium? As in it's so valuable that it's unobtainable except at supreme sacrifice in life and property?This all might not have been so clichéd if there was even a single element of originality to the story. OK  you have your tricked out mix and match dinosaur knock-offs  like the hammerhead triceratops  but come on. What almost saves the picture from it's overbearing two and a half hour run time is it's exquisite use of day-glo neon and fluorescent color  even though none of it relates to anything in the 'real' world. Which is fine from the perspective of creating a visually stunning landscape coming straight from the creator's imagination. However as I think about it now  I was more impressed with the extraordinarily vibrant use of natural color in a couple of martial arts films  ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"".And then there's the relationship between Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Here's the mental leap of faith you have to take  and no one seems to have thought about it. Jake Sully is a HUMAN BEING  given a synthetic Na'vi body to integrate with the Pandoran population. He eventually becomes romantically involved with Neytiri  an entirely different  ten foot tall species. How exactly does that work? Say  let's get back to my earlier mention of the Western genre. When it came down to the final battle  it struck me rather odd that the Na'vi's donned war paint just like Indians would. Not only that  but in the heat of battle  Neytiri and the other Na'vi women turned into vampires. With a ten year time span to think about all this  it seemed oddly convenient that Cameron wound up taking advantage of the Twilight craze.Finally  and this is a big finally  couldn't the dialog go beyond every known clichéd line in the book? Really  there were so many that it was impossible to keep track. I do remember Colonel Quaritch's ""Come to Papa"" during the final battle  and I just groaned. The only one missing was 'Lock and Load' and seriously  that single line would have lowered my rating for the picture a full point.None of the foregoing should be construed as a recommendation not to see the picture  because I think you'll have to judge it for yourself. It's just that I expected more  and keeping in mind the current political and financial mess that the country is in  I do hope the picture succeeds. I'd hate to think that James Cameron would need a bail out for a picture too big to fail.",positive

Basically  it is 2154  where paraplegic war veteran  marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is being recruited for a mission to the alien planet Pandora  inhabited by the native humanoid race called Na'vi with their own language and culture. To get onto the planet without suspicion  he  fellow soldier Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) and experienced Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) enter a cocoon have their minds enter a new body known as an Avatar to look like the alien race and control is by telepathy  so Jake can walk again in this body. The mission is to first understand more about the Na'vi  Jake manages to gain the trust of Neytiri (Zoë Saldana) and eventually the rest of them  and to find a precious mineral called Unobtanium. As time goes by  it becomes obvious that Jake is enjoying life in the Avatar as a Na'vi a bit too much for the likes of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang)  who promised Jake his real legs back  and Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi). They are turning nasty to get what they want and start stripping the planet  so Jake  Trudy Chacon (Michelle Rodriguez) and the whole of the Na'vi form an army to go against the enemy (the humans) to save what is precious  Pandora itself. Also starring CCH Pounder as Moat  Wes Studi as Eytukan and Laz Alonso as Tsu'tey. 2009 also saw this film break the worldwide record for highest grossing film in the world and of all time  with over $2 billion  ironically beating Cameron's own Titanic (which made over $1 billion). As for the film itself  it might not be the most original of plots  but the performances are good  and the big hook is seeing the amazing special effects take you into another world. The motion-capture is really well done for the blue characters  and the 3D really adds to the beautiful landscapes and colours of the alien world  oh  and for the quite gripping action scenes  so it is an epic science-fiction fantasy to see. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction  Best Cinematography  and Best Visual Effects  and it was nominated for Best Editing  Best Music  Original Score for James Horner  Best Sound  Best Sound Editing  and Best Motion Picture of the Year  it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design  and Best Special Visual Effects  and it was nominated for Best Cinematography  Best Editing  Best Music  Best Sound  and Best Film  and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama  and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score  and Best Original Song for ""I See You"" by Leona Lewis.

Having seen it I can say that I don't think that it was the greatest film ever made and I certainly thought the main story was fairly derivative  it certainly wasn't rubbish though. Even though the story was fairly predictable I found it enjoyable and thought the characters were fairly interesting although the chief bad guy was hammy in such an over the top way he was funny. The real star of the film though was the planet Pandora; the CGI was done so well that it was possible to suspend disbelief and forget that this was a computer generated world.The message of the film is fairly heavy handed; it is clear from early on that the humans on Pandora are the bad guys who are willing to destroy a pristine world and its native population to acquire a valuable mineral. There were a few surprises to be had though; the humans did far more damage to the natives' world than I'd expected and more than one character I'd expected to survive died. If you are one of the few people who still haven't seen this I'd recommend giving it a go to see what all the fuss was about; it might not be perfect but it is spectacular.,positive

In the end  and even though it's a long film (2 hrs  40 minutes) I watched it all and wasn't surprised at much of anything story-wise. Like a lot of modern-day action films  they start off great but slowly become unraveled and during the last third of movie  you have to totally ""check your brains at the door "" but this movie  overall  was fun to watch.For much of it  there were enough visual wonders in here  fantastic colors and special-effects to make up for Director/writer James Cameron's usual Liberal political bias and stereotypical characters. In many respects  you've seen this story before a number of times. In fact  if you've seen ""Dances With Wolves "" you've seen ""Avatar "" the main difference being the setting: instead of the Old West you have a futuristic planet. The story is basically the same  the one filmmakers love to present: the evil white military-like corporation men invade the peaceful natives for greed and profit.... and troubles ensue. Throw in the ""mixed"" romance you saw in ""Dances With Wolves"" and you have a good chunk of this story. Very little has changed except for the futuristic eye candy. Instead of the American Indian  we have the ""Na'vi "" which are portrayed in a very similar light except for the blue skin  of course.The only creativity in this film is in the special-effects department  but - wow - what creativity! The visuals are the attraction to this movie  pure and simple.

There was nothing here that haven't been seen in a bunch of other movies. Actually  Avatar seems to be a million dollar remake of the ""Battle for Terra"" animated movie. Everything in this movie is cliché and seen countless other times. I am not going to give away spoilers for the movie  but once you sit down and watch it  you will go ""hmmm  I have seen this exact storyline and event somewhere else""...Were I to give a rating for the CGI and effects alone  this movie would be a top score  but a movie needs to be more than glamorous effects and fireworks - it needs depth and a solid story. This is where Avatar fell apart.And you just got to love the way Cameron worked in the climate situation propaganda. That was just hilarious!

And Avatar doesn't.As a piece of 100% slam-bang  in-your-face  holy-cow-how-did-they-do-that  OMG-did-I-really-just-see-that entertainment  it is near perfection: the plot brilliantly combines pure imagination and wonder  incredible white-knuckle action  and genuine pathos; the acting is incredible  with the cast giving superb performances  even when given a massive CGI makeover; and Cameron's use of his advanced  state-of-the-art 3D technology is simply incredible  the design of which draws inspiration from many sources—most notably  perhaps  certain progressive rock album covers from the 70s.On a purely personal level  I also loved the fact that both Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez were in the film: they're unlikely bits of totty  I know  but Weaver still has a certain something  even at the age of 60  and Rodriguez has made the hot tough-chick routine all her own.Until someone takes an even mightier leap into the cinematic unknown  developing all the more dazzling techniques to wow an audience (and I'll hazard a guess that that person will be Cameron again)  Avatar has set the bar for stunningly beautiful fantasy entertainment.,positive

He surely knows how to make a movie that captures the fancy of viewers of all ages and from all walks of life. While the actual story is good  its only novelty is that it is based on the distant planet Pandora  and visitors must be put into a cryo-cooled state for the long journey  then awakened upon arrival. Other than that it is a standard story of peoples from different backgrounds with an unlikely love story interwoven. Think Pilgrims and Natives  John Smith and Pocohontas  Romeo and Juliet.The ""hook"" in this movie is the creation of the hybrid Avatar  which has both Earthling DNA and Pandorian DNA  so the resulting being  grown in large pods that simulate development in a womb  emerges fully grown  and is very tall and blue. But this Avatar can't function on its own  it must be controlled by its Earthling  the one whose DNA was used. The Earthling enters a special compartment  and via special electrodes is able to see through the Avatar's eyes  speak through it  run  fight  and everything else through it. But when the Earthling is disconnected the Avatar falls into a deep sleep and remains that way until the Earthling activates it again. This can be tricky! So why are they doing all this? One  to study the Pandorian race  whose atmosphere will not support Earthling life without a special breather. So the Avatar solves that problem. But there is also a rare metal  Unobtanium (I chuckled at their choice of that name!)  which is desperately needed on Earth  but the richest deposits are in the ground under and around the Tree of Life where the Pandorians have made their main home. The peace-loving scientists want to gain Pandorian cooperation to have them move  but their religious connections make that unlikely. The competing group are military and their motto is  if they won't move peacefully then lest blast them out of there  let's incinerate them.The main character is a crippled man  Sam Worthington as Jake Sully. His identical twin brother was to control the Avatar Jake  but unfortunately was killed so Jake  having the same DNa  made him a match. But he had missed the special training. His love interest is the Pandorian  Zoe Saldana as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver is the site scientific leader  Dr. Grace Augustine  and she has her own Avatar.The militant leader is Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch. And the commercial leader  pushing for something to be done is Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge.The animation is superb  the motion-capture technology  which was NOT part of the DVD extras  must have been exotic to enable them to make such realistic looking characters.

Thankfully  the latter he dives into with a lust for cinematic glory and (with more money than some countries have in an entire year) he has made his vision of a planet called Pandora in the year 21-something something of a real wonder. If only his big ideas weren't  for the most part  cribbed from other movies and stories and archetypes. I would be reminded of Joseph Campbell's myth-buster formula that so many have taken to heart in adventure movies  but Cameron's formula would appear to come second to his attention to visual detail. This has its pros and cons  some more or some less depending on what viewer sees/hears in it all.It is ambitious  and quite expensive  and it all shows up on the screen. It has to be said  Avatar is absorbing to look at. So much time and energy was spent into creating this fictional alien species  the Na'vi  and it pays off in the respect that Cameron's visual fx team painstakingly makes it appear real and otherworldly at the same time. We might recognize the lush and green surroundings  or even some of the trippy creatures  and if it comes close to anything it's like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest squared and made semi-pre-historic. But it's the scope and grandeur  and when we see the Na'Vi in close-ups or even just far away  you can see the sweat and the detail in their faces  the human beings playing them projecting off the screen. I forgot  if only for a few moments at a time  that they were animated and done in motion-capture. If part of a filmmaker's job  in a situation like a super-mega-sci-fi epic is to make us believe in another world and place (even if it's familiar)  then Cameron has done his job very admirably.So if Pandora is great to look at (especially in the practically prerequisite 3D  which also has its own levels of detail and nuance and doesn't just JUMP at a viewer)  and if the technology shown on screen- of how a human being goes into an avatar  is fascinating  then why isn't it such a smash all around? Simple - the story  and the characters. Cameron does pay them attention  but only inasmuch as to get us going into the Pandora environment. When he has characters like Jake Sully (very good Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana  even better) saying such trite dialog and going through the motions of a story that is familiar to anyone who has seen Ferngully or Dances with Wolves or  to a lessor extent  Last Samurai or New World (super pro-environment  obvious anti-colonialist)  it starts to drag the film with it. I never grew tired of the cinematography or the wonderful sights on Pandora  but could I have done without such one-dimensional gritting-of-teeth from Stephen Lang? Absolutely.I'm not sure if there should be more movies like Avatar. It takes a filmmaker with the ambition and drive  and the super-screw-you-guys clout that James Cameron has with such a project (not to mention the time for it allotted him - not since Kubrick has a filmmaker taken so long between projects)  to pull off something like this. CGI-driven movies could progress thanks to the prowess displayed here  but it does need to be done with the right frame of attitude towards the story. Even if such story is formulaic as this one  a filmmaker does need to try and push the technology a little further while also not forgetting about the human element. Cameron comes close... no  he does go over the brink of doing style over substance  but for this case- and maybe just this one time from an otherwise masterful blockbuster director- it's satisfying.,positive

They both liked it but were also-especially on Mom's part-a little dizzy from all the 3-D action sequences. Director James Cameron's script-while not really Oscar worthy-certainly moves the story along to the point that you're riveted almost throughout the whole thing. (I have to admit here that during some of the beginning live action sequences  I fell asleep but I managed to be awake when the first computer animated scene came on and stayed so afterwards.) Sigorney Weaver is certainly compelling as the scientist character and it was a nice to see Michelle Rodriguez  who I last watched on ""Lost""  as a heroic pilot. And how awesome were many of those creatures in the jungle  not to mention those action sequences that climaxed the movie! Okay  so on that note  Avatar is definitely worth seeing.",positive

AVATAR takes you beyond your wildest dreams. Special effects keep your eyes glued toward the screen. Cameron says that he has waited 15 years to let technology catch up to what he wanted to present. Four years of production and AVATAR gives us a whole new generation of cinematic experiences.This movie takes place on Pandora  a human outpost light years away  where a rare mineral is being collected to help solve part of Earth's energy crisis. The atmosphere of Pandora is toxic  so the government has created an Avatar program that blends human DNA with that of Pandora's indigenous population called...the Navi. The program allows humans to become ""drivers' of their own consciousness that is downloaded to an ""avatar""...which is actually a hybrid remote-controlled body on Pandora. Jake  a wheelchair bound Marine(Sam Worthington)is given the chance to walk again(as an ""avatar"") as he takes the mission of infiltrating the Navi and convincing them to relocate so the government can mine the sought-after mineral below their communal home. Jake will form a strong relationship with his Navi teacher Neytiri(Zoe Saldana). Jake must make a choice of where his allegiance lies...will he become a traitor? Who's hero will he become? Or will he be a hero at all? Some  I'm sure  will take exception to AVATAR'S finale  which makes no apology to any religious conception. I'd like to think that Cameron chooses to please the most of the masses.

There are not many good storytellers either. Nor  it turns out  many filmmakers who can make even moderately big movies with a single governing imagination. That is the first quality I will report of this: that a single mind governed the creation and dynamics of this world and how we see it. The second quality is the experience of realism in the artificial faces. Both of those are reported by others well enough.What really impressed me was how deeply the philosophy of WETA has penetrated grand film-making. They did the world. Now  the world by itself would be remarkable. But Cameron clearly wanted the dimensionality of ""King Kong"" writ large. The thing is dimensional. The camera is placed in positions that no physical camera could; it moves in ways that are distinctly alien in the alien sections of the movie; the sequence of surrounding shots in a scene  particularly an action scene  is more than double what you normally would get and surrounds. The way it surrounds is taken from what WETA did with ""Van Helsing:"" the movements are those you see in the flight movements of the flying dragons. So they are of the movie and in the thing as well.There is  therefore  a distinctly Australia-New Zealand flavor to this. That isn't the only nontraditional self-referential bit. Cameron loves these. We have the filmmaker to the film as the same as the otherworld immersion set up and controlled by Weaver's character. And indeed she reports that she modeled her character on Cameron. The bit about the forest as a neuronal net is not entirely unlike what visionaries in the computer graphics world talk about having in the future.A significantly unsettling element is the weaponry. Somebody boot ILM out of the game. It is really likely that a future that can master space travel and DNA remoting is likely to rely on Viet Nam era things-that-shoot? The only reason they are there is so that for the final battle we can have traditional cinematic shootouts overlain on our by then well established dimensional reality. And gosh  have we had enough already of the enhancer suits? Though I cheered and cried with the crowd  I wish I could have left feeling that love story was unpolluted by the ordinary. One thing that I will predict. I trace the use of orreries and global machines in films  because it affects the vocabulary we can use in how we grow the cosmologies behind noir. Here we have the trees. One is huge and helical  a home to a population. It is downed like the World Trade towers by a guy out of central casting that in other theaters we are cheering because he is blowing up terrorists. Here he says he is fighting terror preemptively with terror.The second tree — the tree of souls — is not rendered well visually. But the idea is an amazing advance in film scriptology. It moved me as the guiding principle behind the inevitable love. That it collected the soul of Cameron's avatar was a bit delicious. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",positive

I assume that by the time you read my review it will have dropped in the rankings--mostly because the most rabid fans were probably the first to see and review it and the rest of us folks will be getting to it a bit later. This is often the case with big blockbuster films--though with an overall score of about 8.7  it's bound to stay well within IMDb's top 250. As for me  I really enjoyed the movie but cannot agree that the film is THAT good. Excellent yes....#37...nah.The best thing going for ""Guardians"" is that with the huge glut of super-hero films during the last decade or so  this one manages to stand apart--something that cannot be said of most of the films. There is just a certain sameness that make me less than thrilled with all the comic book hero films. But a few  like this film and ""Scott Pilgrim"" manage to seem different enough to merit your rushing to see them. So  of course  rush to see this oneSo how is it different? Well  there are MANY ways. Chris Pratt (Peter Quill) is NOT your typical super-hero. He is NOT a disaffected millionaire or guy bitten by a spider or a super-being from outer space- -he's actually pretty ordinary in most ways. But  like his character on ""Parks and Recreation""  Pratt is a bit of a goof-ball--a dopey but likable guy who manages to do well despite himself. This is kind of cute--but fortunately the film is NOT just about a dopey goof-ball but he's assisted by a strange group of new-found friends with strange abilities. Another way this is VERY different is that almost the entire film takes place in outer space. While ""Thor"" and ""Superman"" have their brief moments in space  ""Guardians"" is almost completely there--and as such has a HUGE reliance on special effects and CGI. It is a SUPER- expensive film because of this and its all-star cast--coming in at about $170 000 000--which is greater than the gross national product of many nations!!! So  although the film has earned over $100 000 000. it has a long way to go to earn back its costs--though I am pretty sure this will soon be the case. As for these special effects  they are beautiful and the film has such an other-worldly look as it jumps from one weird planet to another. So  the film is absolutely jam-packed with eye candy. Finally  the dialog (mostly from Pratt but also due a lot to his new friend  a VERY sentient raccoon) is amazingly strange. Often crude  it sounds much like the dialog was spiced up a bit here and there by 13 year-olds. While I usually don't like this  it DOES make the film very different.So what's not to like? Well  not much. However  because the story has so much action and CGI  you do sacrifice a bit when it comes to plot  back story of many of the characters and you might just feel a bit overwhelmed. Still  it's the sort of overwhelmed I don't mind feeling from time to time.By the way  if you do see the film  you'll certainly enjoy the obligatory Stan Lee cameo--it's one of the better ones I can recall.",positive

To me  not quite. Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy' well made and entertaining? Absolutely.'Guardians of the Galaxy' boasts spectacular special effects  gorgeously psychedelic colours  slick-yet-with-enough-visual-depth cinematography (nothing cartoonish or plastic here) and very colourful and atmospheric sets that more than effectively makes one think they are immersed in this galaxy. Costumes and make-up are also of very good quality. The 70s soundtrack and score is rousing and touchingly nostalgic. The action is beautifully edited  choreographed with lots of entertainment value and thrills and is at best exhilarating  there's plenty of it without feeling too much.James Gunn directs with style and a sure hand  always seeming as if he knew what tone he was going for and who he was aiming at ('Guardians of the Galaxy' is far and above anything else he's done and his best overall direction is here as well. Personally really enjoyed the way that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was written too  the jokes are enormously entertaining and the film also has heart with a genuinely emotional opening. The story is non-stop energy and compelling  with a nice balance of comedy  drama and section. It is not perfect  and is one of the film's weaker points  with a been-there-done-that feel  a couple of overly-sentimental moments and a couple of randomly placed moments that were not needed at all and just took away from the flow and tone of the scene (Chris Pratt's dance).The characters are on the most part incredibly colourful and engaging  with a great chemistry throughout. Peter is a likable lead character and Groot is quite adorable and amusing  but Rocket the Racoon doesn't just threaten to steal the show  to me Rocket actually does steal the show. The one exception really is the very bland and barely developed villain Ronan. Chris Pratt is highly charismatic  Zoe Saldana is suitably fiery  Karen Gillan is imposingly formidable  Dave Bautista induces lots of laughs and charm while showing a very intensely played vengeful side (though that was a little too hastily introduced) and a surprisingly well-cast Vin Diesel does a great job as Groot. Bradley Cooper stands out  being a sheer delight as Rocky. Lee Pace tries but struggles to bring any menace or dimension to Ronan  can't say I blame him as anybody given the role if written in the way it was here would have struggled to bring believability to it.All in all  not perfect and not quite as great as all that but exciting  well-made and lots of fun  really enjoyed it. 8/10 Bethany Cox,positive

The setting is outer space and the film is a sensory overload at first  featuring an unknown cast of colourful alien beings interacting in a standard storyline involving the possession of a magical  world-destroying device. The first thing you notice is the quality of the CGI effects  which as in the recent DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES  are quite remarkable and photo-realistic for the main part.The hero of the piece is Chris Pratt  nowadays hot property but an actor I can take or leave. He does his usual cocky routine  but the supporting cast are much more interesting: Zoe Saldana takes a similar role to her one in AVATAR but has a lot more fun  while Dave Bautista is hilarious and even Bradley Cooper's raccoon character is lovable. Groot isn't quite on the same level as Treebeard but is still amusing  and you have to love others like Michael Rooker's larger-than-life space pirate. The plot is derivative and predictable  and the spaceship action scenes are still copying STAR WARS some thirty-plus years later  but the camaraderie is good-natured and  more importantly  funny. The result is a light and breezy movie that never loses momentum  and leaves you happily looking forward to the sequel.,positive

It didn't matter here because while progressing the story  we were filled in well by commentary from the characters. Chris Pratt is a funny guy with his endless sincerity and optimism. What works here  and what others have said  is the humor is offhand enough  but funny enough  to not interfere with the mission. The good guys (as well as the sort-of good guys) have a nice chemistry. Some are clueless and some are simply very clever. I remember seeing the ads for this a year or so ago and the raccoon put me off in the ads. As it turns out  he was a dynamic  sympathetic character who is himself a victim of circumstances. He ever gets called a hamster at one point. Anyway  I just wanted to weigh in on a very entertaining film. I'm sure the sequel will continue the fun.,positive

The film made the IMDb top250  got lots of love from audiences and critics  finished no°3 of the year in terms of box office and was nominated for two Academy Awards. The cast includes a handful pretty famous names  but it was especially a breakthrough for Chris Pratt  who was probably only known to fans of ""Parks & Recreation"" before. The story is a bit similar to ""Despicable Me"" as we have a criminal here as well who changes sides. Actually  it is not just one criminal  but a whole bunch. Writer and director James Gunn made very smart decisions here by how he chose to make the bad guys look likable. The raccoon and the tree are just cool  but Bautista's character for example only really became evil because of what happened to his family.Speaking of James Gunn  he is known to be a director who had quite a few flops during his career  in terms of box office  but also in terms of critical reception  so it was quite surprising how well he did with this film here  certainly well enough that there will be a sequel  probably more than one unless this sequel really bombs  which is almost impossible I think. I myself enjoyed the movie too. Its biggest strength are definitely the characters who are all so memorable and unique that it is a delight to watch them. The only one I do not count among these is probably Ronan  who seemed a bit one-dimensional to me as the main villain  but even he wasn't bad  just not as notable as the other characters I guess. I am not a great fan of Vin Diesel or Bradley Cooper I must admit  but their characters are simply amazing in this film.I am probably a bit biased because I almost always enjoy superhero films  but this one was certainly worth the watch. One thing I liked about it is that it never gets lost in boastful action sequences as many of these genre films do  but this basically only has an extended scene of explosions etc. near the end and that is very much acceptable. The rest of the film focuses a lot more on character development and creating a smart story. And this was very much needed with so many characters. This is far from a one man show à la ""Iron Man"". Every (anti-)hero gets his fair share of screen time. I recommend ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and I will probably also watch the sequel once it comes out. Also nice that they did not try hard to push this film towards the 150-minute mark. It works very well at approximately 2 hours. Thumbs up  go check it out.",positive

On my second viewing I appreciated the film more. Its an entertaining and anarchic B movie  fast and frenetic but it also felt messy and incoherent and also tricky to get into.Having watched the other Marvel characters where you are introduced into the world of Thor or Iron Man or Captain America here you sometimes feel that you have ended up in someone's party uninvited and no amount of 1970s music will make you feel at home. Its difficult to work out the motivation between some of the characters and the antagonism such as Quill and Yondu.The film takes it cue from some post modern Star Wars mixed with Indiana Jones in space. The CGI characters Groot and Rocket just about work in the film. I still not sure whether its Bradley Cooper voicing it as he sounds so different because he plays him as a more lovable Joe Pesci gangster type.However a bunch of misfits who argue and mistrust each other before putting away their differences and uniting to fight a common foe was played out in The Avengers film.,positive

They self-proclaim Guardians of the Galaxy and decide to deliver the orb to the leader Nova Prime (Glenn Close) to keep it safe from Ronan. But they are hunted down by Ronan and his right-arm Nebula (Karen Gillan) that want to destroy Xandar and also by Yondu Udonta and the Ravagers that want to sell the infinity stone to make lots of money. Who will keep the powerful orb?""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is certainly one of the best sci-fi of this year. The story is a rip-off Star Wars but full of action and very funny  in a perfect combination of action and comedy. The characters are charismatic and the cast has great names – the only remark is the name of Vin Diesel highlighted in the credits that lure the audience since his character has limited lines (""I am Groot""; ""We Are Groot"" once and a couple of grumbles. The special effects are top-notch and the music score with songs from the 80's is remarkable. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Guardiões da Galáxia"" (""Guardians of the Galaxy"")",positive

They perhaps have a point but it is hard to really pay it much mind when the genre produces films which are fun and entertaining. With its massive success and the fact that it comes with association to already successful franchises  Guardians of the Galaxy perhaps looks like an easy film  but I do wonder how much people were taking a risk when they greenlit a sci-fi film based on an pretty much unknown comic book series  with a lot of things that could potentially have been really silly; seeing Howard the Duck in here is also a reminder of how something that is quite cool in theory can fail to connect to the audience. What makes it work though is that it is really light fun  easy to get lost in because you are laughing or smiling for the majority of it. It is at its best when the main characters are allowed to do their thing  with the best laughs coming from the banter between them (who would have thought that wrestler Bautista would have such great comic timing). The silliness is kept at bay by how tightly funny it is; it is sharp  daft  cool and engaging. The actors do well  with Pratt being charming fun  Saldana being more than just a figure  Cooper having a lot of presence with his voice  Bautista getting lots of laughs with his straight delivery  while Vin Diesel (who must have wondering if they were making fun of him with this casting) produces one of the most lovable characters with only a few lines of dialogue.While the cast have good timing  it should also be said that the film does too – for example cutting away briefly during an action sequence for one line to get a good laugh. The film unfortunately is not quite as strong when it has more serious or narrative driven moments. The opening of the film is a good example of this  but it is just as relevant during more intense moments or serious 'franchise' moments  because it still needs to be a film. The mix just about works  and the laughs  fun and cool silliness carry it across moments where it has none of this.It is not a work of art  and it is not as remarkable or brilliant as some would have you believe  but it is still very entertaining. In a genre filled with action-packed but overly serious films  or films that are just silly in a bad way  it is quite refreshing to be able to watch such a film  laugh all the way through it and come out having enjoyed it a lot for how well it balances  judges and delivers the humor consistently.,positive

The movie centers around a group of five ""losers"" who are after an orb that looks like a baseball size ""snitch."" I couldn't help but think about other block buster films while watching this one. Our 5 ""good guys"" are:Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is the main character. As a child he was abducted from Earth right after the death of his mother. He carries with him a Sony Walkman and plays a cassette tape that should have disintegrated long ago. He is a combination of Hans Solo and Kevin Bacon from ""Footloose."" His playing of classic rock tunes gave me a flashback to ""Heavy Metal"" as they looked for the orb.Gamora (Zoe Saldana)- works for bad guy Ronan (Lee Pace). She is green like an Orion slave girl and every bit of pretty. She refuses to be an easy conquest for Peter and refuses to dance. She is after Peter for the orb.Rocket (Bradley Cooper-voice)- perhaps short for Rocket J. Raccoon. He is a genetic experiment and a bounty hunter after Peter for the bounty. He is quick and clever  but touchy about rodent remarks.Groot (Vin Diesel- voice) is a Treebeard looking character. He can only say ""I am Groot"" which Rocket can understand from tonal inflections. In the beginning they are a pair like Master-Blaster  except Groot's character ""grows"" during the film.Drax (Dave Bautista) is a muscle bound individual reminding me of a dumb Riddick  which is maybe why Vin Diesel didn't play that role. He is out for revenge against Ronan.The main bad guy is Ronan. We know he is a bad guy because he wears a Darth Vader helmet  has a guy who looks like Darth Maul guard him and answers to an Emperor looking fellow. The difference is that is Ronan lacks the heart and humor of Darth Vader.This is a galaxy where everyone speaks English  but no one understands the metaphors. The film is light and formulaic. It is very entertaining and demands a sequel. Just don't think too hard.Parental Guide: Quill flips a guy off. Some PG-13 swearing. No f-bombs",positive

But even so  this will not be everyones cup of tea. Some will not even be into the Star-Lord (or is written as one word?). When you have Bradley Cooper  but have him only in a talking role (he's the raccoon)  then it shows you have real faith in the material. Actually the director of Slither shows off he can handle bigger stuff.There is a lot going for the movie (be it the cast  might be the best movie Bautista has done and will be in for a while) and if you love Science Fiction  this might not have sounded like a shoo-in  I myself never thought I'd like this movie so much. But how could I think Marvel could go wrong? I don't know  but of course they didn't. They choose their directors wisely and their cast wisely too. Chris Pratt is someone you might have seen in many comedies before  all with small budgets or him in a supporting role (as in Delivery Man  a remake of a french movie with Vince Vaughn being top billed) .. things are about to be changed! People will know his name (his real one ... maybe also Star-Lord).There are so many little jokes in here  that it's not possible to list them all. On another note: As with every Marvel movie there is a stinger (scene) at the end of the movie  involving a character I never expected to see. A real treat  even though I have no clue if this is foreshadowing or just a joke. Whatever the case  sit through it and watch! :o),positive

Unless you followed the comic book  the characters are refreshingly new  and coming together the way they do in the story  manage to iron out their differences with each other in order to form an effective team. The story itself we may have seen a dozen times before but it doesn't much matter. And in case you were wondering  no raccoons or tree creatures were harmed during the making of the picture.

What makes this film so special and appealing is the tremendous feeling of loyalty and camaraderie amongst the colorful and likable misfit protagonists: They're a scrappy ragtag bunch who initially don't seem that decent or heroic  but in the long run prove they got the right courageous stuff to qualify as true guardians of the galaxy. Chris Pratt makes for an engaging and charismatic lead. Zoe Saldana likewise shines as one tough and formidable gal. Dave Baustita provides loads of brawny charm as the vengeful Drax. Vin Diesel's throaty rumble fits perfectly for gentle giant sentient tree Groot (""I am Groot""). Michael Rooker has an absolute ball as the fearsome leader of a gang of interstellar pirates. Moreover  such familiar faces as Glenn Close  John C. Reilly  Bernicio Del Toro  and Gregg Henry acquit themselves well in neat secondary roles. Stan Lee and Lloyd Kaufman pop up in amusing cameos. However  it's Bradley Cooper's exemplary vocal work as the resourceful and quick-thinking raccoon Rocket who almost steals the whole show; Cooper projects both a fierce sense of sharp sarcastic humor and a genuinely surprising vulnerability as this lovable mutant rodent. Alas  Lee Pace's petulant Ronan rates as a rather blah central villain  but fortunately Karen Gillian as the bitter Nebula compensates for this. The choice soundtrack of 70's rock gems and a wealth of inspired pop culture references -- love that Howard the Duck cameo at the very end! -- add immensely to the overall irresistibly spirited merriment.",positive

Twenty six years later he is roaming the galaxy as a thief known  if only to himself  as Star Lord. He steals a mysterious orb and soon everybody is after him; some because there is a bounty on his head others because there are those who want the orb for the power it holds. The soon crosses paths with bounty hunters Rocket and Groot; a genetically engineered racoon-like being and a walking tree  and Gamora  an attractive green woman who is after the orb. They are all arrested and while in jail form an unlikely partnership; they are joined by a fifth member  Drax  who wants revenge against Ronan  the being who murdered his family. They manage to escape but there troubles are far from over; Ronan wants the orb as it holds the power to destroy those he opposes. Few people they approach can be trusted and much of the time they don't trust each other... it will be a miracle if they can save each other let alone the galaxy!When I saw that this was a Marvel film I initially thought it might be yet another superhero film; it isn't. Instead we get a space opera which is full of action  humour and some fine lead characters. It may not be quite as high camp as 'The Fifth Element' or 'Jupiter Ascending' it is in that ballpark with over-the-top villains and exotic aliens. The plot might not provide too many surprises but it does give exciting scene after exciting scene. The characters are great; I particularly liked Groot; despite his very limited vocabulary. The cast does a fine job; this includes those we see and those who provide the voices for the animated characters. The special effects are top notch; they make the animated characters fit seamlessly into the live action and provide spectacular backdrops to impressive action. The use of music from the '60s and '70s was fun and nicely justified by the fact that Quinn had a tape of his mother's favourite music... of course the idea that he could play it for over twenty years without it being chewed up is perhaps the most unlikely part of the film! Overall I'd say this is a really fun sci-fi romp that can be enjoyed by anybody who enjoys the genre but doesn't take it too seriously.,positive

That  and plus it has Vin Diesel in it  which is always a no-no for me.However  it would turn out that I had really been missing out on something great and entertaining here. And it turned out that this was actually the best Marvel movie to date. I was especially pleased with this not being another pointless superhero movie  which I associate Marvel with.I am not going to delve into details with the storyline here. Just a quick summary. A band of ragtag spacers come together as their fates intertwine and must band together in order to save the entire galaxy.What worked in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" for me was a couple of things. The storyline for starters  because this was really an entertaining movie from start to end  and it was a story that you could submerge yourself into  because there were so many aspects to it  that there was just something for just about everyone. But also because of the special effects; wow! I was blown away by the special effects  especially because it was so realistic and so vivid; lots of color and vibrant things on the screen throughout the movie. Which leads me to the characters  which were very interesting  well some more so than others.I really enjoyed the Rocket character (voiced by Bradley Cooper)  he was really a blast. Pardon the pun! He had so much charm and wits  and he was just a delight to watch as he unfolded on the screen. And close after him were Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt) and Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana). I can't really claim to be overly impressed or entertained by the Drax character (played by Dave Bautista) and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). But hey  all a matter of individual preference.""Guardians of the Galaxy"" really was a genuinely entertaining movie in every aspect  and it is a movie that you can watch more than just a single time. That  in itself  is some noteworthy accomplishment  especially since many newer movies fail to accomplish that.I was more than impressed with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and I am not shy to admit that I had really been missing out on a grand adventure.

Yes  GOTG features a couple of genuinely funny moments  but it also has more than its fair share of gags that fall flat and certainly do not warrant the kind of belly laughs that I could hear (probably coming from deluded Marvel fan-boys).However  even with its frequently-less-than-hilarious comedic moments  this big-budget dollop of sci-fi comic book silliness still manages to be quite a lot of mindless popcorn fun  delivering enough weird and wonderful characters  fantastic worlds  spectacular action set-pieces and impressive special effects wizardry to guarantee a reasonably fun time.

Summer blockbusters should be fun as disposable entertainments (or on the flip-side can be detrimental to your brain and well-being if they're not)  and yet Guardians of the Galaxy  Marvel Studios' 10th feature film in eight years  has a little more to offer than the usual. At least  it should be said  with its characters and most of its cast. Plus  it's a comedy deep down - with some tragic roots that aren't totally ignored - and it stays true to that and makes it more memorable on those grounds. If it's not THE best of the MCU flicks yet  it's probably the funniest by way of its ensemble.After little ""Starlord"" (yeah  it's not his name  but might as well) loses his mother at the start of the movie (and yeah  a bit of a dramatic start  but director James Gunn makes it real and impactful) and happens to get  yes  sucked up into a spaceship by some mysterious group  it cuts ahead to twenty years later as the boy is now a man (Chris Pratt)  a kind of bounty hunter but for objects instead of people. Somehow one thing leads to another and he winds up in a prison  alongside a motley crew of other 'low-lifes' like Rocket Raccoon (voiced by  yes  Bradley Cooper)  his companion/partner/Tree-Monster Groot (Vin Diesel)  a woman (Zoe Saldana) who is actually from a family of royalty but gets shuffled out by a betrayal of sorts  and Dave Bautista as a Big-Headed Lunk named Drax who's one crutch is that he takes things very literally (including gestures that seem self-explanatory).This central ensemble is cast and played with excellent timing and a strong variety. No one member is alike  even though there's plenty of sarcasm to go around - Starlord is like a Han Solo  but to a point so is Rocket Raccoon  and of all things it's the latter who is the most 'bad-ass' of the bunch with his technical skills  though also the most unbalanced - and quirks and distrust is a-plenty. There's a lot of comedy in the writing  including some off-kilter sexual references - which  for me as a summer movie presumably meant for kids  made me giddy that they could get away with it  and more importantly that they were hilarious - but also Pratt has excellent timing and chops with everyone. And yet he doesn't play it all for laughs all the time  and when called upon to be serious or call back to his character's mother and past  he can go there too.The fact that Gunn can get the audience so worked up about this group is really endearing (he described the difference between them and the Avengers like the difference between the Stones and the Beatles  similar songs to play in a group  but varied approach to the music with Guardians being harder edged)  including  yes  a giant tree and an over-bearing Meat-Head like Draxx. And there are a couple of solid supporting players who have just delightfully bizarre science-fiction/space-opera get ups (this is also a variation on Star Wars of course); Benicio del-Toro in his one scene and Michael Rooker  the best 'villain' type character of the film as Starlord's a-hole mentor  steal their scenes completely.I mention all this good stuff  not to mention some winning action set-pieces and occasionally truly spectacular special effects  because the main plot of the film isn't all that great. It's a little been-here-done-that  the Magic Item (one of the items that will eventually make up the Infinity Gauntlet) that has to be saved and protected  and a main villain via Lee Pace that just isn't interesting or compelling. He does what he can  but there isn't much room to do past what is required. It's almost as if Gunn and Nicole Perlman (the writers) knew they had to work with this boiler-plate sci-fi story  did decently  served the franchise that's continuing  and decided that the best way to make this worthwhile would be to give the really choice stuff to the heroes. For me the only thing keeping it back from the heights of The Avengers is a really captivating villain or stakes in that regard.But if you watch it for these main players  their rapore with one another  the awesomely self-conscious soundtrack (you laugh when certain songs come up  and tap your feet at the same time)  and some of the wilder visuals that can come up for these planets and settings - and did I mention a f***ing raccoon is one of the great characters of the past several years in mainstream films  it must be said again - it's popcorn bliss for a couple hours and change.",positive

Hearing mention of the original Footloose and that movie's star  Kevin Bacon  was also awesome! Also such was the by-now-familiar Stan Lee cameo and seeing someone like Glenn Close taking a role here. So on that note  I highly recommend Guardians of the Galaxy.,positive

Despite having some great superheroes  the films based on their characters often have sucked. However  one of the best and most worthwhile films based on their comics is WELL worth seeing...""V for Vendetta"".The story is placed in a dystopian future. According to this future  the United States has been torn apart by civil war and disasters. And  the United Kingdom has gone from a constitutional monarchy to a repressive fascist dictatorship. But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge. To create a climate of fear and chaos  the government has created fake terrorists...and used the deaths of 10s of thousands of Brits as an excuse to control the country with an iron fist.The only hope Britain has is a weird nehilistic superhero  V. V (Hugo Weaving) is determined to bring down the government and give the country back to the people. But how? And what part does Evey (Natalie Portman) play in all this? See the film.This is a very exciting and intelligent film. It definitely kept my interest...much of it because the whole thing (aside from the near indestructable anti-hero) seemed possible! Well worth seeing and exceptionally well made.By the way  if you like this film  try the 1960s Italian film ""Danger: Diabolik"". Both have very  very similar themes and both are wonderful movies.",positive

I will say  as someone who hasn't read the book  that it is not a terrible movie  just underwhelming.Pros: The best thing about V for Vendetta was by far the visuals. The whole film looks fantastic  the camera work and editing are smooth and stylish and the costume and set design are sophisticated. The score/soundtrack was also effective  enhancing the atmosphere when it needed to and had some memorable parts too.The lighting is brooding and like the score enhance the atmosphere effectively. The idea was also intriguing.Cons: What didn't work for me was the plot  things weren't explained very well or were underdeveloped  it was sluggish and it just had a very shallow feel to it. I didn't care for the characters either  like the plot they were underdeveloped and and lacked any sort of depth. The script is often stilted  the direction lacked efficiency and despite the cast the acting didn't work for me either.Hugo Weaving has moments when he is commanding but his weak dialogue let him down  also the characterisation itself seemed threadbare. Natalie Portman seems wooden here  while great actors like John Hurt are underused or forgettable  in regard to Hurt what was even more disappointing was that he suffered from both these things.All in all  I just didn't care for V for Vendetta  despite the stunning visuals  atmospheric music and the interesting concept. 4/10 Bethany Cox,positive

He rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from the creepy policemen.The general state of affairs is too confused early on. Other than the crazed ramblings of a madman  there isn't much explaining. It's all generalities and high minded language. It would help to set aside a small segment to explain this universe a little better at the beginning. They really should have either concentration camps  unending wars  book burnings  or goose stepping. Instead the setting feels like today's world slightly shifted. It's not enough. The thing with George Orwell. He created completely new worlds. There's so much they could have done.V's voice is distracting. Speaking thru the mask is problematic. It leaves conversation with him cold and distant. It would be better to cut those scenes down. The pacing gets very slow in the middle. The police is chasing him down  but there's never a close call. It grinds down as they slowly reveal the history. It's way too slow  way too late. They should have done this earlier  in a shorter prelude section. This is what the 1st act is for. And if this is such a police state with control of the media  how the heck did that program get on the air in the first place?

The story  about a totalitarian state that uses fear and terror to win the elections and dominate the population  inclusive forging terrorist attacks  is much updated. There are many excellent lines in this Orwellian story  but I would like to highlight the following ones: ""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""; and ""Ideas are bulletproof"". The awesome Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" fits amazingly perfect to both scenes of explosion. ""V for Vendetta"" is not only a brilliant tale of revenge as the name suggests  but mostly a magnificent message and hymn of freedom.

It is not perfect but it is very enjoyable for what it does,2006-12-11,"Evey Hammond is heading out after curfew when the Government's Finger Men catch her and decide to enact their own form of justice on her. Her only rescue comes in the form of a masked man in a cape. This man then proceeds to show her the destruction of the Old Bailey. The Government spring into action to spin the story  control the people and find the terrorist. The police track Evey from CCTV and head to her work place (the Government controlled television station) to detain her. ""V"" arrives before them and uses the emergency station to broadcast his own message of unrest  elevating his ""terrorist"" stance against the Government in a year long war that will culminate on the 5th November one way or the other.It probably helps to be in the UK to really appreciate what this film does well. I don't mean that in a snobby way but it is a success of the film that it produces a vision of the UK that is both futuristic but yet recognisable as our current condition. It does this most easily by visually mixing the design of homes and people's lives with all the trimmings of a totalitarian state but it also does it by making the links to our current political state of control and Government intrusion in the name of ""terrorism control"" and protection. Although it is only a year old  the film still shows a lot of foresight when viewed with hindsight and in doing so it produces an effectively bleak attack on our current political climate. It is effective mainly because it doesn't ever feel that far fetched thanks to the details but mainly thanks to the overriding themes of fear and control being used by a Government.The surprise and joy of finding this level of social commentary in a what appeared to be a Hollywood action movie helped cover up some of the weaknesses. Some viewers have complained about the lack of action in the film; personally I do not see this as a weakness because this is more to do with how the film was sold rather than how it was made. The weaknesses are minor and include the asks the plot makes in regards the ability of V to do what he does and how far-fetched some of it is etc but  like I said  these are covered by how relevant and interesting I found the story. The cast are mostly good. It took me a good twenty minutes to accept Portman's accent but after that she won me over. She is very much in the shadow of Weaving  who shows what a great voice he has by producing a wonderful character without a glimpse of his face throughout. Rea is a bit dour but he does convince as a worn-down public servant faced with the truth about his masters. Fry wasn't that good but does what he had to do in a small role. Hurt and Pigott-Smith are both very good; Hurt particularly convinced as the sort of person who rises to power and delivered convincing lines in a convincing manner  it is telling he has little screen time but a large impact. McTeigue direction was surprisingly good and he delivered the whole affair with a real downbeat air while I'm sure some pressure must have been on him to deliver a big budget action movie for the summer season. He is well supported by the designers behind the visuals.Those seeking action to compare with the Matrix (or even action) will feel let down and I can understand why  the trailers have talked up this side and talked down the social commentary side (and this is a damning verdict of how public tastes are viewed from Hollywood) but credit to the makers for producing a film that surprised me by how relevant it was. Over the coming years this will either become a thing of its time or more relevant than ever (I hope the former) but right now it is an effective story  told with the unreal air of graphic novel but with enough to link it to the present to keep it relevant. I was genuinely surprised by how good it was and how engaged I was by it.",positive

That is the central haunting question presented in ""V For Vendetta""  a stylish thriller nominally adapted from the comic book of the same name. That the film comes out now is not surprising  what is though is that the source material was originally published in 1988/89  pre-dating by a decade a global world in which terrorism has become a household word.Comparisons drawn to Nazi Germany are probably apt  as the film's reining government and it's leader Sutler (John Hurt) have succeeded in convincing the masses what to sleep  eat and think. The revelation of Sutler's inhuman plot to save his country's citizens from a self induced plague that killed eighty thousand people seems utterly unbelievable  yet a real life Hitler found it prudent to kill nearly eight times as many to insure racial hegemony. It's interesting to note that the level of V's violence was tempered to each victim's own arrogance and complicity. Dr. Surridge (Sinead Cusack) as an example was already dead before she even knew it  dispassionate in the knowledge of her guilt and almost welcoming it.In a field of outstanding portrayals  Natalie Portman excels as the tormented accomplice Evey Hammond. Her performance arcs over an entire spectrum of characterizations and emotions  and not once did I feel her reactions were forced or unnatural. She grows Evey from an ambivalent  unthinking member of the hive to a leader  with more courage and determination than allowing herself credit for. It will be interesting to see if she's given credit for her performance a year from now in the next Academy Award go round.The film prompts me to seek out the trade paperback of the original story as scripted by Alan Moore in a ten issue run. My curiosity is also piqued as to Moore's public disavowal of the movie  for that I'll have to learn more. Also while still on the subject  the movie's opening credits Vertigo  an imprint of DC Comics  which was not involved in the original publication.With a movie of such complexity  another viewing is probably a worthwhile endeavor to pick up the threads that might have been overlooked the first time around. However if all you're interested in is an action movie  this is one you probably want to stay away from. Action it has  but it's the subtext and message that should be grabbing you  not the wizardry of flashing weapons.",positive

And seeing what kind of society the movie portrays  it's hard not to sympathize with the terrorist (or is he a freedom fighter?).The movie portrays an arch-totalitarian England sometime in the future. Because of the wars waged by the United States  the whole world exploded into war  the US got reduced to a third world country  and the fascistic Adam Sutler (John Hurt) seized power in England. Imposing devout Christianity on everyone  he rules with the slogan ""England prevails!"".However  Sutler's days just might be numbered. A masked man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) seeks to overthrow this dictator on November 5  to commemorate Guy Fawkes trying to blow up parliament. V had gotten disfigured some years earlier from an explosion in a chemical plant where he was a test subject  and thus wears this mask.One night  V rescues young Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from Sutler's thugs  and slowly but surely draws her into his world of rebellion. As it is  Evey has a reason to go along with V: her parents were political activists murdered by Sutler's forces. So what will this all come down to? I must say that this movie really draws you in. While uneasy about supporting terrorist activity  one realizes that there's no alternative. Naturally  that brings up the issue of the current state of the world. Is Sutler Bush  we may ask. (No  Sutler actually has a brain.) I think that my favorite line in the movie is ""We report the news  not fabricate it. That's the government's job."" All in all  this gives movies based on graphic novels a really good name. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Also starring Stephen Rea  Stephen Fry and Tim Pigott-Smith.",positive

It makes me sad that Alan Moore decided to preemptively disown this film  because unlike ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman""  this is a winner. (And I liked ""From Hell""  even if Moore didn't.) I'm a little partial to this film. I love the musical themes  the alliteration. I love the anti-government  pro-populace message. I do own the graphic novel. But underneath all that  this film offers it all.There's romance (and I mean actual romance  not just people screwing around on a gaming table). There's action  fighting and explosions. There's intense drama (I cried a few times  especially during the prison sequences). I suppose the humor might be lacking  but I hadn't really noticed because everything else is done in just the right amounts.If you like Portman  like good dramas and action films  and are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (there are some things that might be just a small stretch of impossibility) this is a must-see. Already firmly planted on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250  I have no doubt it will stay there for a great many years.",positive

The film begins with the capture and hanging of Guy Fawkes  and then forwards to a not too distant looking future (2038) Great Britain  in which a masked (with the face of Guy Fawke) known only as V - or later William Rookwood (Hugo Weaving) - blows up the Old Bailey building on November 5th. He warns everyone that in 364 days from that night  he will do what the real Guy Fawkes planned and blow up the Houses of Parliament. Orphan Evey (Natalie Portman) finds herself helping V escape from the authorities  and slowly falling for him. V by the way is a very enigmatic terrorist  or vigilante if you like  who uses a lot of poetry and Shakespearian dialect to get his points across. There is a point when she is ""captureD2 (and has her hair chopped off)  when it was in fact V. Trying to find V are Inspector Finch (The Crying Game's Stephen Rea) and Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith)  under the watch of their boss  a Big Brother type figure  Adam Sutler (John Hurt). So November 5th approaches  and Evey does come back to V  after he let her go  till the day of course  and he does sacrifice himself  before the streets are swarmed with hundreds of people in his image  and the Houses of Parliament blow up. Also starring Stephen Fry as Deitrich  Rupert Graves as Dominic  Roger Allam as Lewis Prothero  Ben Miles as Dascomb and Sinéad Cusack as Delia Surridge. V (which by the way in Roman numeral means five) is a very intriguing character  with knives and razors to slice up people in his way  and yet he speaks so poetically  you can't help but like him  and Weaving was the perfect choice. Portman does quite well with the English accent  and supporting cast members Rea  Hurt and Fry add some good depth  it is along the lines of something like A Clockwork Orange  Fight Club or Twelve Monkeys  very enigmatic with hidden messages  but a good film none-the-less.

Here Britain is governed by High Chancellor Sutler  played by the excellent John Hurt. We learn that he came to power after a terrorist outrage that left tens of thousands of people dead. Once elected he had set about building a police state where undesirables were eliminated.The main character of the film is Evey (Natalie Portman with a slightly dodgy accent)  a girl who is rescued from the police by a masked man known only as V  played by Hugo Weaving who performs well in a role where we never see his face as it is always covered by hid Guy Falkes mask.Shortly after rescuing her he takes her to a rooftop to watch as he detonates explosives that he has planted under the Old Bailey. He then announces that that in one years time  on the fifth of November he will blow up the now disused Houses of Parliament. He also sets about killing a group of people who have wronged him in the past. Inspector Finch  an honest policeman played well by Stephen Rea is tasked with bringing V to justice. The more he learns about V's victims and their connection to the government the more disturbed be becomes.Many viewers seem to consider this a left wing film that is attacking right wing values by taking them to an extreme; I never thought that though  to me it is a film about the evil of tyranny which would have worked in exactly the same way had the government been Stalinist.The acting is good throughout  the secondary characters were also impressive  especially Stephen Fry who played a television presenter who sheltered Evey at one point  in many ways his character is the non-violent equivalent of V  they even cook the same thing for breakfast.,positive

As ¨V¨ utilizes terrorist action against London landmarks but his objective results to be the fighting against the fascist state ruling over Great Britain and governed by a dictator   chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) . The authoritarian tyranny rules over citizens with oppression and violence and ¨V¨ is urging the London citizens to rise up and overthrow the government . Meantime   he saves a beautiful girl named Avey (Natalie Portman) from the violent deputies . She decides becoming his ally and confront the atrocities of the nasty chancellor and his underlings (Tim Piggoth Smith) . Meanwhile   a detective (Stephen Rea) and his helper (Robert Graves) are investigating the terrorist events .This is a thoughtful and broody story containing a clever political criticism and is based on a graphic novel by Allan Moore . The film gets diverse influences   as the myth of ¨the beauty and the beast¨  ¨The phantom of Opera¨  the anti-Utopian literature of ¨1984 ¨ by George Orwell and   of course   ¨The Count of Montecristo¨  but we are seeing images from the classic film and ¨V¨ acts like Edmond Dantes . In fact   the screenplay of the film is remotely similar to that of the Alexandre Dumas novel 'The Count of Monte Cristo' as both stories revolve around characters who escape from imprisonment and proceed in seeking revenge on all of those responsible for their incarceration . The original comic series was originally created by Alan Moore . However  following his negative experience with ¨From Hell¨ (2001) and The league of the extraordinary men¨ (2003)   Moore decided to reject all money and credit from Hollywood on any adaptations of his work . Thus   he gave all the money he would've gotten to the artist who drew the character with him  and rejected his own ""created by"" credit from the film . The movie has a stagy and carnival stylish but with a breathtaking production design by Owen Patterson . Colorful cinematography by Adrian Biddle   he died during the filming and is dedicated to him . The motion picture was well directed by James McTeigue . James   previously   was assistant direction of Wachowski brothers (Larry and Andy)   film producers in high budget along with another great producer   Joel Silver . The flick will appeal to the comic books enthusiastic and Natalie Portman fans . Rating : Above average   well worth watching.",positive

Good!,2006-08-25,Based on the Alan Moore/David Lloyd strip of the same name (which first appeared in top British 80s comic  Warrior)  V for Vendetta is a thoroughly entertaining adaptation which will most likely appeal to fans of the source material  but may leave others expecting summer blockbuster style action a little bemused.V (Hugo Weaving  who remains masked throughout the entire film)  is a freedom fighter in the near future determined to bring down the bully boy fascist government that is controlling England with fear and hate. Dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume  he plots against the state (led by John Hurt's nasty Chancellor Adam Sutler) and the people responsible for both his mistreatment and the death of thousands.Although the film is not 100% faithful to the minutiae of the comic strip  the movie's writers (The Wachowski Brothers) have wisely not strayed too far from Moore's basic vision  delivering a script that retains the core ideas (the importance of freedom and individuality) yet still has time for a little wham-bam action.Whilst the movie is not a complete success (it's a tad too long and drags in a few places)  this big-budget adaptation of the relatively unknown (to the general public  at least) V for Vendetta is a brave move and everyone involved should be applauded. Although I fear that the appeal of the movie will basically be limited to fan-boys  I do hope that others seek this one outthey might be surprised by how good it actually is.,positive

But there is one man who has survived some of the past atrocities and is determined to set things right again  his own way. He simply goes by 'V' and his is a grand Vendetta. Whether a viewer likes this movie depends on what they are looking for. My wife didn't care that much for it  but I really enjoyed it. It isn't as stylized as  for example  'Sin City'  but to me has more of a 'Batman' feel to it. You know that what you are seeing is not to be taken literally  and much of it is social commentary on the dangers of government taking over the 'freedoms' of the citizens.Natalie Portman is into her mid 20s now and a serious young actress. This is a good role for her  as Evey Hammond whose mother and father both fell victim to the government. She meets 'V' (Hugo Weaving  Neo's nemesis in the Matrix) near the beginning of the movie  on November 5th  as they listen to a concert of sorts  while they view the Old Bailey being blown up  all orchestrated by 'V'. The movie ends one year later  on November 5th. I like the mask that 'V' wears  reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's 'Joker' face  but this mask never comes off  and appears to be bullet proof. The cast contains a whole host of fine British actors  including Stephen Rea as Inspector Eric Finch  Stephen Fry as Gordon Deitrich  John Hurt as the evil Chancellor Adam Sutler  and Sinéad Cusack as Delia Surridge. The movie contains much violence  much bloodshed  and has some very dark themes. But it is worth a viewing.SPOILERS FOLLOW. As 'V' systematically tracks down and destroys each of the enemies whom he had targeted  and police are looking for Evey  the two of them become companions of sorts. While Evey doesn't approve of all the killing  she begins to sympathize with his cause  and in fact falls in love with him. His final act was to be sending a train loaded with explosives into the Parliament building on November 5th. But as he is dying after the final fight  he walks away and gives Evey the option to pull the lever and start the train. It is  after all  her future world  not his. She does  and the movie ends with a spectacular display. NB - 'V' got his strength and other powers after surviving government virus testing and also a fire  the mask and gloves were partly to cover his disfigurement.,positive

But to say that I haven't been this excited about a film brought by Andy and Larry Wachowski  the Matrix creators  since their 1999 ground-breaker  is saying a lot. Some may not like the film  or may not 'get' it  as it does go for a lot of dialog and character development over useless explosions and violence (of course there's some in the film  but no in over-abundance). But it is  like the first Matrix  quite challenging in the futuristic story kind of way  taking more from Orwell this time at a look of totalitarian society and the humanism that lies beneath terror and fear through dominance. That it is also a well made and well acted film is much to its credit.And while the film is credited as its director to James McTiegue  who was AD on the Matrix trilogy  one can see the Wachowski's (possibly akin to the V character) pulling the strings throughout in their script and co-producer credits. They take from a graphic novel and churn out something rather epic  and complex. V (Hugo Weaving  in maybe his greatest performance without a 'real' face) has set the date November the 5th as a kind of judgment day  as one year from that date he will return to change the course of history. But in this year's time Evie (Natalie Portman) gets in the cross-hairs  and becomes involved in his vengeance against the government that did this ""monstrosity"" to him. Through this there is an investigation by an officer (Stephen Rea)  some good deal of back-story through flashbacks involving a tragic character who's life is scribed on a roll of toilet paper  and the whole story of how this totalitarian society in England came to be.It's through this story  of which even I can't say that much more  that the Wachowski's deliver some action  however more food for thought than some might come in thinking it will be. For those expecting the non-stop action that went with the first Matrix you might be disappointed. But if you come in with an open mind  like with the Matrix sequels  it won't spell what came for many as disappointment. The talk in those films  which became muddled through the action at times  isn't so here. And through the cast of actors  who are all very  very good (particularly Portman  Weaving  Rea  and of course John Hurt as the high chancellor)  there are some individual scenes that are just great  and entertaining  and involving dramatically in ways the filmmakers didn't quite get on their previous efforts. One favorite for me was the fake TV show with the two John Hurt characters in a comedy kind of scene. And the whole sequence with Evie in the 'prison' is surprisingly moving. If I could make criticism of the film upon a first viewing  yes  it is sometimes a bit 'talky'  and the direction is not as astonishing as with the ones squarely helmed by the brothers.But for any of the small flaws seen on a first viewing  I can say that they weren't enough to deter me from recommending it  enough even to say that it SHOULD be seen twice  even if there isn't much confusion on what the story or characters are. One thing's for sure  you're likely to see very few other science fiction dramas this original this year  if at all  and least of which challenge the viewer's expectations and intelligence like this does. And great song over the end credits  by the way.",positive

Suppose you gather groups of people by the millions to overtly support your enterprise  wrapped in gloss and foreshadowing. Suppose you decide to make it humorless and obvious; and to make it whole and logical not because it is those things but because your confidence makes its seem so.Well  you'd have what this film has built itself against. But you'd also have what this film is.Will we never learn? Do the brothers suppose they aren't paving the way for simplistic munchkin politics? If you want a subversive film  go to Greenaway.Yet  I can admire how this thing is put together. It is highly cinematic visually even though most of the thing is talking. But even that is tricky because the talker is behind a mask  so we largely invent the images in our own minds  prompted from time to time with inserted visions.The first half is the Count of Agatha Cristie  where we are presented with an old fashioned detective story except presented from the criminal's perspective. Serial killings are ticked off and we want to know why. Though we follow the killer  our inquiries are handled by the on screen detective.This is followed by an ""Oldboy"" segment  a radical shift  perhaps equally well done. And then we shift into ""Irreversible"" mode as we slide into the sappy movieland happy ending. Fireworks.Along the way  we are pounded with self-reference to video media: our heroine and her pal work in TeeVee. The central Valerie character is a filmmaker who incidentally creates the film we are watching indirectly by writing it on toilet paper and passing it as if behind a mask.Our hero is motivated by a certain old movie.

Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore (who has said he didn't like the film) & David Lloyd (who has said he did like the film) I didn't expect such a great film  while the original graphic novel was about V on a quest to create anarchy rather than freedom from an oppressive Government I think the film works extremely well & a lot f it seemed very relevant & topical. Lets be honest  V for Vendetta has a dig at the likes of George Bush & Tony Blair as it presents Britian in the near future as a society run by a dictator & a corrupt Government who have twisted the war on terrorism  the need for security & the fears ordinary people have to take away people civil liberties & freedom just like we are heading towards right now if truth be told. I could also relate to the way Sutler uses & manipulates the media  it's all quite close to home & familiar actually. At over two hours I was never bored by a largely talky film  it held my interest from stat to finish with some great writing  some touching writing  some humorous writing  some exciting writing & some satirical writing. The character's are all strong & there's one great twist about half way through I didn't see coming that was genuine surprise that at first seemed a bit odd but then after thinking about it seemed totally logical.Based on a comic book there's a great visual style to the film  from the cool fighting & action scenes to some surprisingly touching scenes sensitively shot. I loved the idea of using Guy Fawkes  I am not sure if he is that well known outside of the UK but here the 5th of November is celebrated every year & Fawkes story is know to all. The idea of using the morals & image of Fawkes & the ideas behind the image is a great one that works perfectly (but I guess you would have to know of Fawkes for it to). The special effects are impressive with a cool shot of the House of Parliment being blown up at the end. There is some blood & violence but overall there's more talk although when the action does arrive it's cool. I also loved the dominoes bit  sure it's pointless but it looks great & since it took over 200 hours to set up in reality a lot of time went into creating it.With a supposed budget of about $54 000 000 this wasn't as big budgeted as some Hollywood films although it does look great & is surely one of the most political films released during the decade  the parallels between the future society seen in V for Vendetta & the the way our own is heading is there for all to see & the similarity between Sutler & certain other well known leaders is also striking. The acting is great from all expect Portman who is a bit flat although tremendous credit goes to Hugo Weaving who manages to put in a great performance & give V real depth despite being hidden behind a mask the entire film.V for Vendetta is a marvellous film  both as an action fantasy with lush visuals & as an extreme look at where society is heading  the ambiguity surrounding the character of V helps too as a sort of masked hero who simply just stands for ideas & values. A new personal favourite of mine  I highly recommend it.,positive

I just don't get it.,2015-07-29,"I wish I'd never seen that ""Leon: The Professional"" was rated #27 on IMDb. With an outrageously high score like this  I get my expectations too high--way too high. Now I am not saying it's a bad film but it's certainly not THAT good. In fact  it's not among writer/director Luc Besson's best (""The Fifth Element"" and ""La Femme Nikita"" are definitely better). Why is it rated so highly? The film stars Jean Reno as a top ninja-like assassin. However  in an odd twist  this lone wolf killer falls in with a girl (Natalie Portman) and he becomes her foster dad. This is hard to believe but even harder to believe is his training her to be a killer as well as he going after the baddie lone wolf style! And  speaking of the baddie  Gary Oldman pretty much plays the same guy he played in ""The Fifth Element"". Saying the film has some ridiculously difficult to believe aspects is certainly an understatement. Now I am not saying it's bad...but it cannot be a great film  in my opinion  if so much of it is difficult to believe. Interesting  yes....top 100...no way.By the way  I think it's safe to assume that Portman was named Mathilda in the film because of her and her family's strong similarity to the characters in the Raold Dahl book ""Matilda"".",negative

Visually  it is very stylish  with striking location work  atmospheric lighting and really authentic and bold cinematography. The soundtrack also does very well in enhancing the mood of each scene  and Besson's direction is faultless.There is also a gripping story with well crafted characters particularly Mathilda and Jean Reno's character Leon  a cracking script and crisp pacing and while there are some over-the-top and intense moments particularly with Stansfield and the beginning  particularly as the chemistry between Mathilda and Leon expands there are some poignant ones too.The acting is excellent. Jean Reno is charismatic and commanding in the title role while Gary Oldman is wildly bombastic as Stansfield. But I was especially impressed by Natalie Portman  who delivers one of the best and most captivating feature debuts ever. In conclusion  a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox,positive

I'm always one to give foreign film-makers a try  as they usually offer up something a little bit more stylish and different than the usual formula. Take Lucio Fulci with his trademark 'hard' and nightmarish horror films  Dario Argento with his gory yet stylistic giallo films  or John Woo's violent  ballet-like action films.Luc Besson doesn't disappoint with this film  offering us his typical lashings of wit  and drawing charisma and charm from his cast. While THE FIFTH ELEMENT bordered on being silly in places  it was still a fun science fiction film  and kudos to the man for experimenting with different genres. LEON is probably the first film that brought him to the typical American's attention  and I would say deservedly so. While masquerading as a typical action-filled gun fest  it is in fact a film of three parts. The beginning is packed with horrible  unflinching violence from killers who don't have the slightest feeling of remorse - Jean Reno expertly massacres a squad of bodyguards  while Gary Oldman shotguns children and people in the bath. The middle of the film is more like a conventional drama  and it tells the story of Leon  the hit-man  and Mathilda  the young orphaned victim  and their growing love for one another which draws the human side of Leon out of his impassive shell. The ending is indeed all out action.All parts of the film are great  and Besson frequently shows his American contemporaries how it should be done. As the box says  it is extremely hard-hitting at the beginning  with deaths shown in all their bloody impact. The ending is also brilliant  with a SWAT team laying siege to Leon's apartment; this is non-stop  violent action and easily rivals any blockbuster like FACE/OFF. However  the film's main triumph is that it really makes us care about the two central characters  thanks to the script  Besson  and of course the actors involved.This is the film that really made Jean Reno something of a star. He's great as the Bruce Willis-like ageing hero  even if he does mercilessly kill people. Natalie Portman is also likable as the child who is old beyond her years  and almost unrecognisable from the bland role she played in STAR WARS. The villain is a drug-taking maniac  brilliantly played with startling intensity by Gary Oldman  who frequently shows his competitors how it should be done. LEON may be sentimental  but this sentiment slowly grows from the start and is realistic and believable  it is not shoved down our throats. Also  check out the ending  which manages to be very good and fitting  and yet sad at the same time. It will make you yell and cry in equal measure.,positive

His next door neighbor 12 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman) has an abusive father (Michael Badalucco) who skimmed drugs off of Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Stansfield massacres the family. She comes home to find Stansfield's men still there. She fakes and walks over to Léon's. It turns out that they are corrupt DEA agents. Léon the cleaner reluctantly lets her in and she badgers him to teach her. She seeks revenge on his little brother's murderers.Director Luc Besson brings his often collaborator Jean Reno to America and makes a nice discovery with a young Natalie Portman. Before Hit-Girl  there was Mathilda. Gary Oldman is a superb strange bad guy. Luc Besson has a certain French flair with his action. He really has a unique take on the action thriller genre. It definitely has an edgy violent style that sometimes sexualized the young Portman. She takes on a lot of adult tendencies. That probably held it back a little back in the day.,positive

The film went almost completely under the radar in terms of awards recognition outside of France  but its reputation steadily rose over the years and it is now pretty much considered a classic. Besson was in his mid-30s when he made this movie  but already had a respectable résumé including a French and English version of ""Nikita"". For Reno and Oldman this is probably still the most famous work (not counting Oldman's efforts in the Batman movies) and for Portman it goes right along with other blockbusters like ""V for Vendetta"" and ""Black Swan""  which gave her the Oscar. I am still a bit disappointed Reno was not present at the ceremony. For Portman  Mathilda was the first role in a movie. Also in the film is Danny Aiello as a friend to Léon. His role wasn't clear early on to me as it seemed unsure what he was doing with the money  but as the film went on it showed that he was pretty close to Léon.The film begins with an introduction of what Léon does. He is a contract killer  who  in fact only wants a little talk as we find out in the first sequence. The way he disappears into the dark is pretty cool. What is a more sad than cool is the one scene where Léon's loneliness is displayed. However  when we see him in the theater he does not seem to mind at all. His face expression while watching the movie is so much fun. He is also a milk junkie (just like myself). Sadly  I got no little girl that brings all this milk to me. There are many cult references closely connected with this film: the shades  the long coat  the piggy  the plant (rootless like Léon  nice quote)  the chewing gum trick... After the intro  Portman and Oldman (character name Stansfield  a pill-popping Beethoven-listening psychopath cop) pretty much enter the film at the same time. Oldman's character is really scary  even his colleagues fear him. If you listen closely  Matilda's dad only dares to shout at Stansfield's partner Malky  not at him. The fact that Oldman is not physically intimidating at all makes him even scarier as he must be a complete nutcase if people three times his size fear him. Another little snippet: One of the actors who play Stansfield's helpers died during the terrorist attacks on 9/11 during his work as a firefighter seven years after the movie. When Mathilda's family is killed  the writers already gave it their best to make them look as unlikeable as possible being very violent to their daughter/sister  except the very small one of course. It's pretty sad when Mathilda describes him as a kid who only wanted to cuddle. However  we also find out that her dad paid a tuition fee for one year in advance  so he can't be all bad. I wondered about Oldman's character why the internal commission isn't getting worried if so many people that cross his way keep dying.One of my favorite scenes from the film is when Mathilda returns with the milk  hears her family is dead and knocks on Léon's door. Very intense moment with her begging going against his principles. Finally he lets her in  physically and mentally into his life. He becomes her mentor  she becomes his housewife and quickly develops some sexual tension (quiz game for example or talk about virginity as well being at an age where girls start dating their classmates. She doesn't go to school  so there is no such possibility.) At the same time  Léon also turns into some kind of father figure to her. She looks up to him and also starts dressing more and more like him. Even if she seems very tough  there's a handful scenes where we see how immature and naive she really is  like when she tells the hotel worker that Léon is her lover or also her cartoon addiction or how she pours in the alcohol.The movie is at its most entertaining when the two go to work together. The scene with LaSardo (great actor) is pure gold and when they shoot the jogging politician from far away  it is also slightly special. Another funny comment by Léon is the ""hurry or he will never shut up"" after they run into gunshots. An emotional highlight is Mathilda's attempted suicide. She asks him what she is to him. He says nothing  yet contradicts himself by pulling the gun away in time. Almost a bit of a spoiler scene is when Léon tells Aiello's character to give Mathilda the money if something happens to him. One of the most intense scenes is when Stansfield and Mathilda meet in the bathroom. Edge-of-seat stuff and it shows that Stansfield is really scared of nothing  not even killing a girl in police headquarters. The possibly most beautiful camera shot of the film is when we see Léon and Mathilda reunited at one point and the camera shows us their feet. The last half hour is almost exclusively action sequences. I enjoyed these despite generally not being a great action movie fan. Maybe the reason is that you have made such a strong connection with the two protagonists at this point already. Oldman's way of handling the final act says a lot about him as well. He stays outside of the action to not put his own life in danger  but is a coward who prefers to shoot his victims in the back. When Léon hits the ground  it is a pretty sad moment (just like the farewell scene a couple minutes earlier) as we see it from his perspective. The film ends with Mathilda deciding to go back to school and a beautiful Sting song before the credits roll in.Wonderful movie  over two hours very much worth watching.",positive

His godfather and mentor is the mobster Tony (Danny Aiello)  who loves León as if he were his own son  and his cold blood makes him a perfect killer. When Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his gang executes the family of his twelve years old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman)  León lodges the girl in his place  beginning a weird friendship between a killer and a confused girl wishing revenge. When Mathilda finds who Stansfield is  she presses León to kill him. 'León' is a wonderful movie  having one of the most perfect chemistry in the cinema between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. The storyline recalls some parts of John Cassavetes' 'Gloria'  but the performances of the debutant Natalie Portman and the always-excellent Jean Reno upgrade this film. There are at least three scenes that I really love: the light on the corridor  when León opens the door for Mathilda; when they are walking together in a New York street  coming towards the camera; and when Stansfield hits León. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'O Profissional' ('The Professional'),positive

However Leon is just that - a love story  everything else is incidental or situation  and has become a modern classic.What makes this work is that Leon is the 40 year old but appears more naive and childlike  while Mathilda is the grown up in a 12 year old's body - a modern version of Lolita.  The love between them is a pure love  like the relationship between two children  where Leon protects Mathilda and cares for her and Mathilda provides a life that fills the cold existence of Leon's hitman-focused lifestyle.Portman is excellent in this role - she has yet to do anything better  Reno is well cast and handles the opening up of his character in a very believable fashion - he is totally convincing as a killer and a nervous child making friends for the first time.  Oldman overacts like a madman!  If you look closely at his shirt sleeves you'll see his cuff links are actually pineapple rings because he's such a big ham!  His performance doesn't sit well beside the others and he seems to be in a different movie at times. However he does bring a cold killer element with it that works well and offsets his eccentricities.A classic love story  look beyond the guns at the two central performances and you'll see one of the most beautiful relationships in modern films.  The ending will fill you with happiness and break your heart in equal measure.,positive

It was about at that point that Gary Oldman's character was revealed to be a cop  and then the head scratching began. I mean  really  did he and his goons have to take out Mathilda's whole family over a drug deal gone bad? And when Stansfield (Oldman) is questioned about the massacre  he storms out yelling that he doesn't have time for this spit? What police force allows it's own to go renegade like that without stepping in? Then you have Mathilda (Natalie Portman). OK  I know we're pushing our kids like never before into a maturity they can't handle  but come on. Was anything about Mathilda believable? I can understand her wanting to get revenge on the scum that killed her family  but she was more than ready to go out and target practice using live rounds on joggers in the park. Who comes up with this stuff? There was nothing remotely believable about anything that occurred in the second half of the story  especially after Leon (Jean Reno) wasted the two cops right inside police headquarters. After that  it all became too absurd for comprehension.So then I call up this flick's stats on the IMDb  and it sits at #35 in the Top 250 of all time! What's that all about? That's just a total perversion of any kind of integrity in the rating system. This film is an escapist action adventure flick where one's sense and rationality is best left checked at the door on the way in. To give it the kind of adulation that most of the reviewers here seem to bestow upon it just makes me wonder what we all have become. It's not pretty.,positive

In what is essentially an exercise—a slick urban thriller—it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it.""

Basically Leone 'Léon' Montana (Jean Reno) is the professional hit-man  or ""cleaner""  who only drinks milk  cares for a houseplant and loves Gene Kelly musicals  and he lives next to Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman) is the twelve year old New York girl living with her little Brother (Carl J. Matusovich) and her dysfunctional family. Mathilda's Father (Michael Badalucco) is being paid by corrupt DEA cops to store cocaine in his house  and when they find out he has been stealing some of it for himself  sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman 'Stan' Stansfield (Gary Oldman) leads his team of agents to kill him and his family. Mathilda managed to escape death going shopping  and Léon lets him into his apartment knowing she is all alone  and she eventually finds out his deadly profession  but she doesn't see this as a threat  but an opportunity. She is willing to pay him a fee he has mentioned to kill the people responsible for killing her family  well  specifically her brother  or teach her to use the weapons of his trade  so he does this. So Léon teaches her how to use many firearms  particularly a scoped rifle  and in return she does chores in the apartment and teaches him some skills he lacks  such as literacy  and in doing so she claims she is falling in love with him. One day  after learning what she thinks is enough to do the job herself  Mathilda takes a number of weapons in a bag to go and hunt Stansfield down  posing as an innocent delivery girl  but he ambushes her  until Léon arrives to take her away. After gaining the information of Léon's whereabouts from friend Tony (Danny Aiello)  Stansfield gets a team of SWAT-like masked men to take Mathilda hostage and infiltrate the apartment  but Léon's skills get the better of them and he gets her back safely. She manages to escape going down an air shaft  and Léon looks like he is going to make his way out posing as one of the masked men with bad injuries  but Stansfield recognises him. The end sees Léon nearly getting away  but being shot by Stansfield  and blowing himself and the villain up with active grenades  and after being refused a hit-man existence  Mathilda tries to return to school  and she plants Léon's beloved plant in a field. Also starring Peter Appel as Malky  Ellen Greene as Mathilda's Mother and Elizabeth Regen as Mathilda's Sister. Reno gives a wonderful performance as the loner with all the skills  Oldman is great as a dark drug taking villain on the wrong side of the law  and young Portman almost steals the show as the girl wanting revenge  and obviously Reno and Portman together create sparks. It is an action filled film  with some funny moments  some dark  atmospheric and suspenseful moments  as well as touching moments with the title character and his female friend bonding  a must see thriller.

The only week scene in my mind was when Leon was teaching her how to shoot a sniper's rifle and when she fires we learn she wasn't using live ammunition but some sort of paint-ball  it just seemed a bit of a cop out.. perhaps it was thought having a young girl killing a random person would have led to problems with the censors.,positive

Returning from an innocent trip to the grocery she finds that Gary Oldman and his goons have killed her entire family and are rummaging around  looking for some lost dope.Being a smart kid  Portman slowly carries her grocery bags past the open door to the blood-spattered room  past Oldman's lookout man who eyes her suspiciously  and when she reaches the end of the hallway  unable to walk farther  she presses the last doorbell. It doesn't open. The lookout is watching  his pistol in hand. She rings the bell again  whispering  ""Please open it."" Behind Door Number N is Jean Reno  a professional hit man  also with a drawn pistol  watching the goings on through a hole in the door. He works alone  ""no women  no kids""  doesn't want to be involved in somebody else's violence  and he knows the girl's situation.He opens the door and for him it's like opening Pandora's box. All sorts of irrelevant demands are placed on him and he's subject to threats that have nothing to do with his profession.Oldman discovers that Portman was missed in the slaughter and the gang begins its search for her and  ultimately  for him too. Portman smokes cigarettes  is cheeky  wants to learn how to kill people  and whispers to the manager of their new hotel that Reno is not really her father. He's her lover.The manager's expression is a little hard to read. Natalie Portman may be an underdeveloped twelve but she is angelic with her Louise Brooks hair cut and her black choker and her feline eyes and her plump lips. She's not the most convincing little actress in the business but what does it matter? Any normal man would be abnormal if he didn't want to squeeze and bite her.There is a shoot-out at the end or  maybe  a grenade-out would be better. It's not a very sophisticated movie and it doesn't demand much of the viewer. Lone gunman comes to love a little kid and sacrifices himself. And there are a couple of spots meant to be humorous that only sometimes hit the mark. Reno's imitation of John Wayne is superb.In fact  though  Reno is pretty good throughout. What an ""everyman"" kind of face. It's in no way glamorized. He's balding and his chin is stubbled. He dresses like a hobo and looks as if he might smell like a goat.Gary Oldman is a good heavy too  but the movie makes a clear distinction between bad killer Oldman and good killer Reno  who has a soft spot in his heart for beautiful children  rather like Allan Ladd had his kitten in ""This Gun For Hire."" But Portman is cute and Reno is appealing. A divertimento.",positive

This film  with some very sick messages  is uniquely appealing at the same time. To use a popular word of today: it is ""extreme.""The extreme GOOD: 1 - A very different story and a fascinating profile of a strange  likable loner hit-man and a tough little girl and how they help each other soften the other's personality; 2 - A very intense drama at times with tremendous action scenes in the beginning and end  particularly the latter. 3 - The little girl ""Mathilda"" (Natalie Portman's first role) does of the best acting jobs I've ever seen for pre-teen child  and I've seen a number of good ones over the years. It is no surprise she has turned out to be a big star. 4 - Despite his profession  ""Leon"" (Jean Reno) is a very likable character and extremely contradictory  extolling admirable virtues to the little girl (no cursing  no smoking  choosing good friends  etc.) while at the same time teaching her how to shoot people and then using her as an accomplice to murders! Reno's voice is fun to listen to  really different from any other actor I've ever heard. 5 - Gary Oldman  as usual  is great at playing a whacked-out character. The more you watch this film  the more you appreciate his performance. 6 - A very satisfying ending; 7 - Great camera shots by director Luc Besson  who is known for some stylish movie-making.The extreme BAD: 1 - Not only does nice-guy Leon teach Mathilda how to shoot people but.... 2 - the latter (on the extended version) gets drunk and later wants Leon to make love to her ; 3 - Portman uses strong profanity throughout the film. I'm sorry  but a little girl doing and saying all of this is pretty sick! (What kind of parents  by the way  would allow their 11-year-old to play a role like this?) 4 - Another film that makes a killer into the good guy and the police into the bad guys. In the end  though  it's only a movie  just a fictional story and it's job is to entertain....and in that it succeeds amazingly well. Great entertainment in a perverse way.",positive

Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike  and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years  swearing  smoking  and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end  though  it still feels very awkwardSporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest  Mathilda is definitely sexualised  kinda like a cross between Lolita  Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town  which makes her relationship with Léon rather uncomfortable viewing at times  especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other  or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is Léon's lover.Thankfully  the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic  and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from Léon. It's mindlessly entertaining  I suppose  but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).6.5 out of 10  rounded up to 7 for IMDb.,positive

Begins as a rich character study studded with small bursts of violent action  with very little theatrics or inane hyperbole. Unfortunately  in the third act  Besson allows the violence to take over  leading to an over-baked finale with an eye on the commercial market.

A professional hitman and his protege'  a 12-year-old orphan.,2002-06-28,"Updated February 2020: A very intriguing  action-packed 2 hours and 11 minutes. I was bothered a bit by the same thing that bothered Ebert's accurate review  namely the idea of a young girl aspiring to be a ""cleaner"" like the man she adopts after her parents and siblings are killed by a rogue cop when a drug deal goes bad. Also the implied relationship the young girl sought  telling the hotel clerk ""he's not really my father  he's my lover."" Or the circuitous discussion of whether first-time sex is enjoyable  or the scene where she tells him to sleep next to her in the bed. This character is not a little teddy-bear hugging child  but a mature 12-year-old who wants to have a relationship with the older man  no matter how absurd it seems. Probably the French influence.However  all that aside  ""Leon"" is an entertaining and action-packed film. This was Natalie Portman's (Mathilda) first film role  two years before her smart performance in ""Beautiful Girls""  and she is quite remarkable. Gary Oldman is his usual crazy self. Jean Reno is cool as the hit man  a role that fits his image perfectly.The opening scenes  where Leon is hired to ""advise"" a man to stay out of NYC  is one of the best I have seen in any movie and establishes Leon's profession and skill set. And of course the closing OTT action. But the vast middle of the story is a non-sexual love story between Mathilda and Leon  something that neither had experienced before.I initially saw it on DVD  then more recently purchased the BluRay version which has an enhanced soundtrack  especially with inclusion of some really deep bass at appropriate places to heighten the tension. This is one of my favorite re-watches  I've probably watched it more than a dozen times. The BluRay disc also has a set of interesting extras  including actors reflecting on the experience of making Leon.",positive

With Leon  I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville)  Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo)  and America (i.e. Scorsese)  and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier  and more suggestive  than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie  though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself  trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman  also a major breakthrough performance)  abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman  one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away  she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does  and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship  as it unfolds professionally and emotionally  leading to a tremendous  bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough  but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some  I'm not sure)  but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal  it makes the story work somehow  and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene  and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract  and sees a movie  a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater  and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant  after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne  rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly  she starts laughing  and she laughs more  and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is  of course  embarrassed. However  I thought this was just the right touch to this scene  where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny  not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom  and waits. Suddenly  he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used  the tenseness of the two off of one another  it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).So  basically  when Leon finished  I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger  be it in high school or even middle school  I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing  as well as the mentor/pupil relationship  that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clichés  it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional  is hard-hitting when it has to be  soft and funny when it can  and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over.,positive

The theatrical American release called The Professional and the International and Home Video cut titled Leon: The Professional or just Leon. The longer by almost a half hour contains footage edited initially because other than Euro Audiences found the almost sexual but ultimately Platonic relationship between a 12 year old Girl and a 30 something Hit Man just too uncomfortable.It is the complete uncut version that is the more consummate and rich. It is realistic to assume the behavior of either Character and Director Luc Besson manages to approach the line of good taste but never crosses.This is a different kind of Crime/Action Movie to be sure. It definitely has a Non-Hollywood tone and has a gritty feel of the street. This isn't slick  except maybe in the Action scenes that are violent and impressively Artistic  but it is more of a heady affair of some very off the wall Characters. It delivers on many levels and is complex and exciting.This is a powerful Film with some powerhouse Performances. Requires involvement and a bit of tough analysis from the Viewer.

I'm not sure how many  if any  hit-man films came out before ""The Professional""  but being that I haven't heard of any  they could not have been as good. Since ""The Professional""  other hit-man movies have been released  such as ""Assassins""  ""The Specialist""  ""Last Kiss Goodnight""  ""Bourne Identity""  ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith""  and ""Collateral"". In these movies  and other similar movies  the hit-man (or hit-woman) was nicely dressed  clean cut  well spoken  and had seemingly unlimited resources. In contrast  Leon lived in an old apartment  he dressed shabbily  and had a heavy accent that he could not hide. Your affinity for Leon wasn't because he had and was everything you wanted  but because he was a regular guy just like you and me. You got a good feeling of the type of person Leon was even with the few words he spoke.You got an even better insight of Leon when he developed a relationship with Mathilda  who was played by a young yet bold and somewhat enticing Natalie Portman. The movie centered a lot around their relationship. Leon took in Mathilda after her family was killed by some crooked cops. She actually wanted Leon to teach her how to kill so that she could exact revenge. Mathilda was a multi-layered character as well  even though she was a child. As the bond between Leon and Mathilda developed and grew  and the movie funneled towards its apparent end  all that happened before with Leon and Mathilda steered Leon towards his ultimate act of self sacrifice.Leon's end game move did not diminish the movie one bit  on the contrary  it immortalized the movie. Everyone loves a hero  and more often than not the hero lives in the end after having saved the day  leaving everyone jubilant and happy. Very seldom is the hero killed  or more precisely  takes his own life just for the one he loves. Leon and Mathilda may not have been romantically involved  but they definitely forged a strong bond. Leon had some amazing moves in store for the team of police that came after him  but you can't help but feel that he could not and would not have been so determined if it weren't for his love for Mathilda",positive

The script is just a gem  with classic and original lines like ""Stop blowing holes in my ship "" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate  especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming  likable rogue  and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa  Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role  sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas  because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off  I want to mention another aspect of the film  the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers  like James Horner(American Tail  Titanic)  John Williams(ET  Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend  The Shadow) All in all  a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.",positive

With this film first and foremost Depp got himself linked to a commercial success that spawned several sequels. His box office was now secure.But also this is a once in a lifetime chance to do a part that calls for some of the most outrageous overacting you'll ever see. I think Johnny Depp might have been channeling Robert Newton in one of his pirate films  be it Blackbeard or Treasure Island.In fact the plot is a lot like Treasure Island in the sense that Depp is looking to get back his ship the Black Pearl. It was taken over by his former First Mate Barboso played by Geoffrey Rush and the whole crew Depp included is under a really bad curse. A couple of civilians  governor's daughter Keira Knightley and blacksmith Orlando Bloom are also part of the adventure.The Pirates Of The Caribbean blends both the swashbuckling adventure film and the horror genre quite nicely.

In fact the majority of historical adventures made after the '60s aren't usually worth watching. But this film caused a big fuss in the cinema  everybody applauded Johnny Depp's performance  and it even featured cursed pirates who turn into skeletons in the moonlight. Sounded a bit like JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. So I watched it. I guess I should have been forewarned  knowing this was a Disney movie  but I went ahead with best intentions hoping to enjoy the whole thing.Unfortunately  I didn't. This film is a mess. From the moment you first see Johnny Depp you realise what a misfire this is  a popcorn  brainless piece of trash specially geared towards teenage girls. It's a film where the female audience watches only because the ""hunky"" Orlando Bloom is in it. Sorry  girls; although he's pretty (although far too feminine) he can't act for peanuts. I want to see this guy get his teeth into some real material  like when Brad Pitt tore people's throats out in KALIFORNIA. Maybe then I'll respect him. For now he's just a wooden statue  torn loose after his part in LORD OF THE RINGS and already becoming typecast as a handsome but empty action vessel.Nothing wrong with the scenery or the special effects though. The skeleton pirates are great CGI creations but appear far too little. Plus this is a two hour film where nothing happens to further the slim plot for an hour or so. Try hard to stifle the yawns. The story is non-existent  the dialogue atrocious and even worse  clichéd. It's all so predictable these days. The film is played as a comedy  but the jokes are lame and tired. In fact I hated them. The only mildly amusing thing is Mackenzie Crook's wooden eye. As for the action  it sucks. One of the first things you see is Depp sliding down a rope  that was tired when Kevin Costner did it back in WATERWORLD  now its just sad. The sword fight between Depp and Bloom is pathetic  no excitement or skill whatsoever. The action at the finale is also particularly bad and unappealing  with a bunch of characters you want to see die  a load of stupid sets  and more rubbish acting than you can shake a stick at.Depp is atrocious – how desperately did he need the money for this one? Usually Depp makes great choices in some great films. I loved him in FROM HELL and ED WOOD. Here  he acts so over-the-top and stoned all the time  it quickly becomes boring. This isn't acting  it's over-acting  and a disgraceful performance. You're not funny  Depp  so move your backside and make some good films again. Supposedly 'hot' Keira Knightley is also bland  looking like a million other young girls  pretty but nothing to distinguish her. As for the good actors: Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce are given absolutely NOTHING to work with  just standing around and looking good. Geoffrey Rush is also uninvolving as the chief villain  who does nothing very villainous  doesn't even kill anybody I don't think. Rush is poor here. Go back to making proper films! Definitely worth a miss  this one. Total rubbish from beginning to end with only a few good special effects to make it even a little worthwhile. Don't see it. Unless you're a teenage girl. With a crush on a made-up Johnny Depp. And Orlando Sodding Bloom.",positive

He reluctantly agrees because he wants revenge against Barbossa who led a mutiny against him years earlier. The first paragraph in Roger Ebert's review perfectly sums up my feelings on this movie because he makes it clear that there's a nice 90-minute ""B"" movie trapped inside an incredibly long and drawn out 142-minutes. Seriously  142-minutes for a pirate movie? I know this movie has a large group of fans and I know it made hundreds of millions of dollars throughout the world but there are so many great things here that I can't help but feel that they're all wasted simply because someone didn't know how to shout cut and then leave stuff on the cutting room floor. We'll start off with all the good stuff and one can't help but be visually entertained by everything going on. I really loved the look of the sets  the pirate ships  the costumes and of course the dead pirates look terrific as well. I'm not a fan of CGI but I thought they did a pretty good job mixing up the make-up with the special effects and the visual look of the pirates is incredibly good and quite realistic as well. Another major plus is that you can't help but feel as if you're really in the 17th Century. I thought the filmmakers did a terrific job with all the outfits and this here helped add some creditability to the movie. The action scenes are all incredibly well-staged including a terrific bit where the under-maned Sparrow boat must go up against Barbossa's using any item that they can. Another terrific battle happens at the very end but with a summer Blockbuster you expect the action to be good. Then we have the nice performances by Rush  Bloom  Knightley and various other supporting players. I thought Knightley was incredibly good coming off quite sexual as well as being believable in the toughness of the character. Then there's Johnny Depp who picked up an Oscar-nomination for his performance. I can't say I'd call it that great but there's no question that Depp makes the role all his own and even manages to make the performance original  which isn't all that easy to do with a pirate. I really loved the tough of Keith Richards that he threw into the performance and I think any fan of The Stones will enjoy it. However  most of this is wasted because everything just gets dragged out so long that after a while you can't help but feel as if you're got some great eye candy but nothing that tastes overly good. Edit out thirty-minutes and I'd say you'd have a much more entertaining film.",positive

Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion. Will frees Sparrow to pursue her.The movie is bombastic  chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it  this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it  this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess. In a film overstuffed with CGI  big sets and wild characters  Depp has a neon sign flashing over him in one of the most original performance ever in movie history.,positive

Johnny Depp's mugging and swashbuckling. His sly expressions. The conflict with the power structure which would like to see him hanged. The special effects are quite impressive. There are two problems that kept me from giving this the ultimate rating. It is way too long. I don't know if they edited anything out of this. The thing with the ghost ship was endless. Secondly  like a video game  there were all these rules we were supposed to remember. The ones that mortals are supposed to play by and the ones the ghosts must play by. I'm starting to feel that for some films  we should be given a handbook to keep it all straight. Perhaps an in-service of some kind. When this is mostly a pirate movie  it is great fun. There are battles; there is tongue in cheek commentary. There are beautiful women who can stand up to any man; you name it. When the supernatural element enters in  it is also fun. But there's something about being forced to kill people that are already dead. Just exactly is it that you must do? Again  play by the rules. Anyway  it's a wonderful romp. It almost gets resolved in the end  and we're ready for more.,positive

It was no°3 at the 2003 box office behind the final ""Lord of the Rings"" chapter and ""Finding Nemo"". Also it received 5 Academy Award nominations  including Best Actor for Depp (his first nomination ever) and also an SAG Award for him. That is also why there have been 3 sequels already  no°4 is safe and number 5 looks likely too. The first one (just like 2 and 3) was directed by Gore Verbinski  who kept reuniting with Depp after his exit from the Pirates franchise. The writing team already worked together on animation classics like ""Shrek"" and ""Aladdin"". My favorite part from the script was possibly the ""saving the one shot"" storyline and the final shot was one of the highlights of the movie. I was a bit surprised the crew went according to protocol at some point as they seemed extremely loyal to Sparrow initially  but I guess it shows that you can never trust pirates. Thank God Captain Sparrow survived all these dangerous situations early on like the hail of bullets after he saved and threatened Elizabeth Swann or when he almost gets hung near the end of the film. Actually that could have been a nice ending if they hadn't done all these sequels. A bit unexpected  but somehow different.I also thought Geoffrey Rush did a good job with his character (but that's a given as it's Geoffrey Rush)  the main antagonist to Sparrow. His death scene near the end was pretty special. I guess they did not plan to include him in the sequels  but they were wrong. Let's see how they bring him back. Another antagonist  the commodore  I was really fond of. I almost cheered for him more than for Bloom's character (just like Sparrow). It was actually nice for a change to see the rival to be displayed in not such a bad light. I found him likable and you could even call him a hero. Knightley did a solid job too and I liked Depp as well. I'm not his biggest fan  but here he convinced me and made me laugh too. He is a very costume-oriented actor if you look at his body of work and Jack Sparrow may very well be his most memorable role. Orlando Bloom unfortunately still does nothing for me. He is all about his looks and little about being a talented actor in my opinion. This franchise started right after ""The Lord of the Rings""  so they cast him as a crowd magnet I guess. The film is mostly a family movie. Here and there  there is a bit of violence  like ghost pirates cutting throats of Navy officers  but it's all not too graphic or very fast over.Another strength of the film is the music. I am a bit surprised Zimmer was completely snubbed by everybody that awards season as his soundtrack is certainly one of the most memorable from 2003 and pretty much everybody has heard the main theme.",positive

You're in one.""",2020-11-16,"What a great line to describe probably the greatest pirate movie ever. Certainly  it isn't perfect  a bit over the top  yet filled with characters that you love to hate or you can't resist rooting for. Thanks to the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow  this has become a long-lasting franchise of Disney car and love the many sequels that followed up aren't as good  Jack has remained consistently strong in the ones where he was given a great opportunity to show off his huge talents.Johnny was justifiably nominated for an Oscar for his performance in this  and is ably supported by Geoffrey Rush as the ghostly Captain Barbarossa and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner (brought up as a pirate until he was rescued at sea as a child)  and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann  the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island.In his performance  Depp gives several insights into the real character of Jack Sparrow  and it is debated whether he was just an eccentric drunk or possibly gay or bisexual. Certainly  the slaps he gets from various women throughout the film debate the second point  but other insinuations indicate that he had prolactivities. Sparrow and Turner are rivals at first until they must join forces to rescue Elizabeth who is kidnapped by Barbarossa. she goes to a frightening sequence when she learns of who they really are  and that brings terrific elements of horror into the film.Fans of the Disneyland ride will be gleefully surprised to see various elements of it from the drunk man sleeping with tags  the jailed men trying to get a dog to bring over the key or the various battle fights at sea. they are spread throughout the film so you don't feel like you taking the ride and then gone back into a plot  so it makes it fun for experienced riders of that tourist attraction as they pop up.The terrific makeup  costumes  photography and music add to the sensational performances. This takes the best elements of all the classic pirate movies (from ""Treasure Island"" to ""Captain Kidd"") and adds a reality with the violence and filth and crudeness  but somehow  some of the pirates (especially Sparrow) are quite loveable in a strange way. This is non-stop action  filled with humor both physical and verbal  and some of it in spite of the lack of etiquette of the characters is subtlety classy. I can see myself returning to this every couple of years because certainly  like a trip to Disney  it's a ride that you don't want to miss when you have the opportunity.",positive

Elizabeth hides the boy's medallion in order to hide the fact that he is a pirate  she also thinks she sees the mysterious ship The Black Pearl.  Years later Elizabeth is being wooed by officers while Will is a blacksmith in her father's service.  When her  medallion calls out to another force  it brings the crew of the Pearl to the bay in search of the gold.  Elizabeth is kidnapped and Will resolves to go after her.  He turns to the only man he knows who knows the black pearl  incarcerated pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.  However how can you trust a pirate's word?I'll be honest and say that I didn't want to see this film  I had been totally turned off by the trailer.  The one attempt at humour in the trailer is that awful `try wearing a corset' line  it didn't get a laugh in the film or on the trailer.  However I did go and see it and  after Hulk and Matrix  I was very glad I did.  The plot is pretty enjoyable allowing for lots of fights but also enough twists and turns to hold the interest.  It doesn't all make total sense but  like the ride it is based on  the film moves on before you have time to think too hard about anything.Unlike those other blockbusters I mentioned  POTC doesn't take itself too seriously.  It doesn't make fun of itself either  but it does have it's tongue in it's cheek the whole time.  This is seen in the vein of gentle humour that runs through it in the dialogue  action and characters  the film is basically having fun so it is easy for the audience to get with it too.As every other reviewer on earth has said  the biggest strength of the film is Depp's Captain Jack.  Playing him like a drugged out rock star who clings to his half-fame like a life raft  Depp wrings so much humour out of every line  every scene and every little thing he does (`but why is the rum on fire?' being my favourite line).  It is a performance that could have been awful but he pitches it just perfectly and stops the film ever becoming anything less than fun.  The only downside of his character (who makes his appearance on a ship revealed to be a tiny  sinking boat) is that the film sags a little when he is off screen for longer than 5 minutes.Bloom and Knightly carry the film's more serious core and thus have a less glorious job.  Both do well however and are good if not quite stars  certainly I was surprised to see Knightly with such a big role in a big film.  Rush enjoys himself as Barbossa and the crew also have fun.  The effects are used just as they should always be used  to compliment the film rather than be the raison d'etre!  The effects are good without replacing plot or characters  they are well blended into the flow so never bring the film to a halt by their use (although wine flowing through and out of Barbossa is pretty impressive).Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal.  Sure it is not a classic film or a perfect one  but it does exactly what a summer film should be  entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously and moves a long at a fair pace without ever lapsing into impatient editing or flashy visuals.  Having said that  if Depp was not onboard the film would be much the lesser.  His exaggerated performance enhances the tongue in cheek feel to the film and makes it a much funnier  livelier and all round fun experience.,positive

First of all  for resurrecting the pirate movie ""genre"" (maybe genre is not the right word  but you get what I mean) and also for sticking to Johnnys decision to play Sparrow the way he did!

So I'm finally getting back to it this many years later and even though I'd forgotten a lot about the story  I was blown away all over again by the outrageous antics of Captain Jack Sparrow and those transition scenes where the skeleton pirates manifest in the moonlight. In fact  the story itself might be incidental to the special effects and physical stunts that highlight the action in the film. Johnny Depp of course makes the movie with his swish-buckling (yeah  I misspelled it on purpose) approach to the character  and you couldn't ask for a more fetching lady in distress than Keira Knightley  although she managed to hold her own against most of those menacing pirates quite nicely.

It's the usual Disney adventure story which means the same good and bad traits I usually find  namely:THE GOOD - Nice camera-work and very slick-looking on DVD. Interesting characters  mostly here the ones played by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. It's difficult to find a role in which Depp doesn't play someone odd and/or fascinating. The story has a good mixture of drama  action  suspense and humor. Keira Knightley is attractive as the female lead and the story is interesting for the full 133 minutes (the last 10 minutes are ending credits.)THE BAD - Once again  the messages are ""laws are made to be broken;"" ""rebels in society are the good guys while authority figures are the villains "" and the girl wants the poor man over the rich man  etc. etc. That all is so '60s clichéd by now  you'd think the Baby Boomers in Hollywood would grow up  but apparently not. These traits are in almost every film  including a worldly outlook on everything  which includes glorifying occult nonsense. Disney will never change.OVERALL - A fun movie  thanks mainly to Depp  director Gore Verbnski and his cameramen  and successful enough to spawn a sequel.",positive

I enjoy him in all his roles  and in fact just finished seeing him (again!) as Don Juan Demarco  an underrated movie where he and Brando interact so well. He also did a fine job here as Captain Jack Sparrow  the pirate without a ship. Keira Knightly is fine as the beautiful maiden in distress. Geoffrey Rush  one of the great and versatile actors of our time  is superb as the evil and wiley nemesis Captain Barbossa. The special effects are very well done  and the cinematography is beautiful. However  both times I have seen it  I was never able to get into the story  the curse  and the pirates who appeared as skeletons under moonlight. It is a good and fun movie  but maybe more for the younger crowd  as my 15-year-old neighbors and my two young grandchildren enjoyed it very much. I don't believe it belongs in the top 250  nor does it warrant the (so far) 34% of '10' votes on the IMDb.,positive

Impressive. Their acting is good. But you could have put a bunch of unknowns in this film along with Johnny Depp and the film would still have been a hit.Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow  who goes along with blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) as he tries to find Elizabeth Swann  his love (Knightley). She is the daughter of the governor and has been kidnapped by the awful Captain Barbossa (Rush). Barbossa and his crew live under an old curse. They're not dead but they're not alive either. The curse can't be broken without returning all of the gold with each pirate's blood back into the chest.Because of the medallion Elizabeth wears  Barbossa believes she is the one he wants. If he gets her medallion and puts her blood on it  the curse will be broken. He's in for a shock.There are some great special effects  suspense  and humor in this overly long film  as well as some wonderful acting  but Johnny Depp steals the film. His hilarious Jack Sparrow  based on Keith Richard  is fantastic. He makes this a film a cut above the usual adventure film by giving such a quirky performance. As he would say  savvy?,positive

There were endeavors to revive it but ended either in artistic failure. ""Pirates"" (1986) by Roman Polanski enters this category  a project whose preparation was long and arduous and in the end  it was a very impersonal amount and Polanski's absolute nadir of his career with the desultory ""What?"" (1972). Then  ""Cutthroat Island"" (1995) was a contender for the genre but ended in a financial fiasco. Nearly a decade later  Gore Verbinski with whom  a good majority of cine buffs had unearthed in him palpable skills in directing with the chilling ""the Ring"" (2002) and under the command of the Disney firm embarked on a new ship. Direction: the pirate island with the well-intentioned will to restore once for all the reputation of the pirate movie. Unfortunately  he didn't arrive at the end of his trip. His ship fell through. It was a profitable blockbuster for the mighty producer Jerry Bruckheimer who once again lined his pockets. Artistically  well let's be as nice as possible and it will be hard because I had relied on the director of ""the Ring"" to rejuvenate the pirate movie and to deliver a solid entertaining film. My hopes were blighted.It was maybe a mistake to have entrusted him a big-budget film. He seems to have been dwarfed by Bruckheimer's omnipotence. However the latter's trademark is present in virtually each shot  each image of the venture and there's nothing wrong about it: exotic landscapes  lush scenery  lavish costumes  grand score  a whiff of epic movie  pursuits galore  naval engagements  a dash of fight and fusillades sequences and of course  perhaps the indispensable element: swashbuckler which was a specialty of French cinema in the sixties  helped by the unparalleled Jean Marais. There was everything in the same package which brought out a conducive odor to entice and charm the greatest number of viewers.Alas! ""Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl"" is partly plagued by a derivative directing which can't live up to the enormous means and budget the film had at its disposal. Verbinski had been more inspired with ""the Ring"". However  one can feel a buoyant will from Verbinski to film his story. It's true  there's a perennial humor difficult to resist  fast-paced action. There were also visible efforts on the costumes and scenery. Everything to inspire a good amount to dream  liberty to the audience. But Verbinski sedately shoots Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom)'s adventure to find again Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and in the end  the whole smells the reheated. The movie also could have gained by being curtailed of about half an hour.Verbinski's vehicle is also handicapped by its scenario and it's perhaps what hampers most the success of the film. ""The Ring"" had a quite strong screenplay in store but here  it's a snap  slick one. Yes  there are some neat twists to keep the audience interested until the tail end but it also encapsulates major  unacceptable drawbacks which are nonsensical in the story as a whole. So  the malicious pirates took Elizabeth hostage to help them to find a treasure which would make them human beings again (at night  they turn into living dead) but isn't it an excellent opportunity for them to reinforce and establish their power? No  instead they want to become mortal  flesh and blood men again. Then  in the first minutes of the film  after Elizabeth took Will in  she's looking at the sea and as the mist clears away  she can see a pirate ship because of the black flag. The pirate ship is close enough to enable the crew on board to see Elizabeth's ship  so why isn't there a naval engagement? It's also hard to swallow the story of Will's father and the scenarists could have found a better and less far-fetched way to make Depp and Knightley meet. The latter wears a dress with a more than fitted waist and because of this  she falls (from a high height) into the sea (you have to see the sequence to understand it and to realize how ludicrous it is). But fortunately  Depp was in the surroundings... you can guess the rest. There's also some filler in the scenario (when Depp and Knightley are on the desert island).The actors partially redeem the whole. Johnny Depp plays his game well. His mix of gravity and mockery spices up the story. Geoffrey Rush also takes the lion's share about the quality of the acting. But Orlando Bloom delivers a rather wooden acting and Keira Knightley doesn't really display skills of thespian.""Pirates of the Carabbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl"" is plagued by a shoddy story which should have been more stringent. There are also flashy special effects and a mundane directing. To some extent  some qualities of ""the Ring"" which had contributed in cementing its stance of winner have turned into drawbacks here. Once again  there's no accounting for taste but this blockbuster isn't the guarantee of a quality entertaining movie. But the majority of the audience doesn't seem to have this problem. A sequel will reach the streets this summer. Will it be worthwhile?",positive
371,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,2003,PG-13,2h 23min,Action; Adventure; Fantasy; ,9 July 2003 (USA),8,997264,2186,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/1nw9GbNdPavAIOjDP8T0oEdgGXU=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p32093_p_v8_aa.jpg,7,An entertaining jumbalaya of a pirate movie,2003-07-16,Two reasons to see Curse of the Black Pearl (and I'm speaking more to adults  kids will see just about anything they can get into admission-wise) are the effects done on the crew of the Black Pearl  and two performances amongst those that were OK but nothing special- Geoffrey Rush as the taut  creepy captain of the Black Pearl  and especially Johnny Depp as the somewhat unconventional captain Jack Sparrow. On this site it's said that Depp patterned his character's moves and voice after Keith Richards  which I can see  however my first impression watching him was that he was basically playing Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in a pirates cap and with gold fronts. This is indeed an original turn for Depp  even if we've seen him do something like this before  and it helps when a persona is this fresh in a story that counts the numbers a bit too often.Curse tells of a governor's daughter  Elizabeth  who is on the verge of being married to an uptight British officer  despite to pining of blacksmith Will Turner (LOTR's Orlando Bloom). When she is kidnapped by a looting band of pirates one night  he enlists the help of imprisoned Jack Sparrow to find her and the Black Pearl. But when the curse is revealed to Elizabeth that's when things get suspenseful (to a degree). One thing that makes this a worthwhile time for the kids is that it's the first PG-13 film from the Disney people  and though it might have fared a higher calling if it was under a different studio with an R rating  it can give them a chance to see some scenes parents may find a little risqué. For instance  at one point Jack and Elizabeth are stranded on an island (which is all I'll say as to not spoil it)  and he finds a stash of rum in a hiding place  and then the two get hammered under the moonlight. Another instance is when the curse is first revealed  once again under the moonlight  and this can be a perfect introduction to the magic of zombies. The action scenes  however  are the weakest scenes of the film  which is a let-down since there's some good choreography in the swordplay  but there's just something about the way they go on that doesn't catch the viewer in (at least me) like how other action scenes this summer have. By the end of 'Curse'  the audience can see it's nowhere near greatness  but as popcorn fodder it is a pick of the moment. B-,positive

Nevertheless  I was a little entertained by some of the fight sequences and many of the lines and attitude of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character. I'm not completely sure he deserved the Oscar nomination for it but hey  he finally got the public recognition as a result so it's all good. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush are also adequate here so this movie was a little enjoyable to me though I couldn't completely connect the disparate sequences that seemed to meander throughout.

I was actually worried when I saw the names of Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer listed together on one movie-poster ! I always looked at Johnny Depp as he is Hollywood's last ""rebel"" and seeing him in a big budget production ( like the average Bruckheimer film is) would mean we've lost him too. By ""rebel"" I mean that he chooses the roles he really WANTS to play. For himself or for his Hollywood friends ( like Tim Burton for example ) So  in that way  I'm glad to admit I was wrong. Johnny kept his own personal style and personality in this movie. The big money and the huge hype surely hasn't changed his way of film-making. Pirates of the Caribbean is indeed on of the most enjoyable films coming from the last few years and a must see to everyone who likes an original and well made movie. But I wouldn't go so far to call it a masterpiece already. I even saw they've included this film in the list of ""250 best movies ever"" here on this website...That may be a bit soon  I guess. I prefer to await its status within a few years whether to include it or not.But hey  no complaints from me neither... I saw it 3 times so far and loved every single viewing. Making a good movie about pirates is some sort of achievement to itself  actually. This topic seemed to be ""cursed"" to itself ( oh  sweet irony ) because the last attempts of telling a story about pirates all resulted in complete failures. Cuttroat Island by director Renny Harlin was a complete disaster and it messed up the career of Geena Davis. Even the brilliant director Roman Polanski didn't succeed in making an interesting movie about pirates when he tried it  back in 1986. Upcoming talent Gore Verbinski ( his version of the Ring was quite good as well) did succeed and I find this to be quite remarkable...especially when you consider the basic idea behind this film is a roller coaster-ride from Disney Wold.Yes  Johnny Depp is great in it. I said it already and he got lots of praising all over the world for his role  so I think it's not necessary to mention him again. We all know Geoffrey Rush is an overtalented actor and Orlando Bloom is well on his way to build up a great career as well ( not many actors his age can say they starred in 4 of the biggest box office hits of all time  even though 3 of them are part of a trilogy ). I didn't know Keira Knightly yet but she looks cute. In general  I think we can say the acting is flawless. There are also enough fascinating plot twists and funny moments in Pirates of the Caribbean thus it's certainly recommended !! I'd already recommend it if it were  for the used language alone !! I love expressions like "" Ye'd be lost to Davey Jones' Locker"" and several other  typical sayings. But if you really think there's absolutely nothing negative to say about this film  I suggest you stop reading now because I do have a few minor comments on it. First of all there the CGI  I complain about this matter on most modern films  but that's because it bugs me so much. I'm still convinced it's possible to create a visual stunning film without the overuse of computer effects but this movie didn't try to do so. Maybe it's for the best  otherwise many (younger) fans wouldn't have liked it. And I do think this motion picture is a bit like its title...too long. I'm not saying it becomes boring but 145 minutes is a bit long to tell the story in my opinion. Furthermore...no remarks. Off you go...watch this film !!!",positive

It's Disney off the Jerry Bruckheimer production line (so  plan accordingly)  and is eye-pleasingly well-produced. The screenplay  by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio  is quite a nice modernization of the classic ""pirate"" story.The film's greatest strength is Mr. Depp's slosh-buckling  swish-buckling  swaggering  and staggering ""Jack Sparrow"".Depp's characterization cuts through the screen with uncommon  original charm. This part made critics strut up and take notice  with Depp being rewarded with several ""Best Actor"" awards and nominations. This was also the film which vaulted Depp into the Quigley ""Box Office"" Top 10 stars list (#6  with a bullet).

It is the most violent film I have ever seen and find it amazing it didn't get an NC-17 rating. I guess you can't show nudity in American films but bloody graphic violence is okay! What a world. This isn't a complaint against Tarantino--but one about the current insane rating system.This film is not for everyone. In addition to the graphic violence  the film is an Americanized marital arts film with overtones of Italian westerns. If these sort of genres are not something you'd want to see  then once again the film is not one you'd appreciate. As for me  I am a huge fan of martial arts films and Spaghetti westerns  so it was right up my alley--even though I am not a fan of ultra-bloody films. And  because I have loved the films of Sonny Chiba and Shaw Brothers martial arts films  this movie is an absolute must as it is a loving tribute to the genre. So many references to these films are buried within the film  it's best you look through IMDb's trivia section before or after you see the film--then you'll REALLY appreciate the film! In addition to the martial arts angle  the film happens to be perhaps the coolest movie ever made. And  the coolest part of the film  to me  is the music. The soundtrack is simply brilliant and bizarre--from the haunting music of Zamfir to the quirky Japanese all-girl surfer band  the 5  6  7  8s! Almost as cool are the costumes and characters. The 88s  the insane school girl assassin and the rest are really ridiculous but so  so cool. And  the film gets super-high points also for its strange style--ranging from an anime film within the film  a black & white segment and action scenes that go on practically forever! There is a lot more I could say about this film  but considering that it was released seven years ago and there are a zillion reviews for it already  I'll cut this short. While the film is intensely violent  for what it is you simply can't find any better. It is  in the action department  as good as it gets.By the way  this is not a criticism of the film  but have you ever wondered why folks in films of the genre NEVER use guns to stop the hero? You'd think at least ONE of the 88s would have been carrying a gun in the huge fight scene in Japan!!,negative

It's a good movie and even better for those who are fans of the same type of cinema as Tarantino: enjoy pretty much any '70s exploitation movie  from Shaw Brothers kung fu to Japanese samurai  blaxploitation and more  and you'll doubtless enjoy this one. However  this is not up to the level of Tarantino's previous offerings: the plot is wafer-thin and the dialogue is far more sparse than we're used to. His witty repartee is gone  instead replaced with plenty of black humour and more simplistic dialogue. The plot  which feels stretched (perhaps splitting the film in two wasn't such a good idea)  involves Uma Thurman working her way through a hit list in a simple revenge drama. Tarantino's idea was to make just the kind of overblown trash movies he loved watching when younger  and he ably succeeded with this frenetic outing.The movie is packed with action  and very violent action along with it. Japanese cinema is referenced in excessively bloody demises  where arterial fountains are the norm and limbs are chopped off like nobody's business. Elsewhere  you can't help but cheer as Thurman batters and mutilates her way through various killers  rapists  and hired help  and it helps that the actress puts her all into the film  especially physically; I don't think many actresses would be willing to undergo the punishment and unpleasant-looking stuff that Thurman suffers here. Of the other cast members  Lucy Liu makes for an ice cold villain whilst Vivica A. Fox has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it role. Asian film fans will enjoy seeing cult cinema icons Gordon Liu and Sonny Chiba pop up in welcome cameos. Plus there's an endless slew of film references  my favourite being the music taken from MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE! The infamous House of Blue Leaves massacre is easily the highlight of the movie  a twenty-minute action set-piece of outrageous proportions. Effects are purely basic  like those used in the '70s  with thankfully no CGI  and it pays off in spades. This film looks bloody and brilliant. It's just a shame that characterisation is so thin; Thurman has a cold heart which makes it impossible to identify with her at all. It's best just to sit back and enjoy the expertly-choreographed mayhem. Oh  and keep an eye out for the excellent anime sequence which fits perfectly rather than being out of place  which I feared it would be.,positive

It was her wedding day and she was pregnant. She was attacked and now she has no child. She's after vengeance on her attackers. She kills Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) who has since become a suburban housewife. Then we see she has already crossed out O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Then it flashes back to the wedding and when one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) tried to kill her in the hospital. She's saved at the last minute by a call from Bill (David Carradine). The last member of the deadly viper assassination squad is Budd (Michael Madsen).Quentin Tarantino has created a simple action revenge movie reminiscent of the old exploitation kung fu Hong Kong action movies. This is an outrageously simplistic story that is highlighted by some great action scenes. It's a nice spin on the exploitation genre  but I don't know if it's necessary to have a two-parter. It's the only minor complaint I have about this. The story is way too simple to justify the extended running time. There are sections where Tarantino has stretched the movie a little too far. He tries his best to juice it up with some temporal juggling  mixed media  and eastern philosophy. But essentially this is an excuse to exercise some action filmmaking fetish. And it's beautiful when the action is so well done like the battle with O-Ren Ishii.,positive

I watched this with my son shortly after he had had four wisdom teeth removed. He was on pain killers--I was keeping him company and he asked me to rent this. He's much more savvy than I am toward these things. It was intriguing--Quentin Trantino's blood fest. Now  is this a ballet or a movie  because if one does not suspend disbelief (even at the bedrock of the thing) this is just ridiculous. Arms severed  blood flying  one gory scene after another  one trying to outdo the previous one. As with most of this stuff  anyone who has ever banged his shin or cut himself  knows that it takes very little to disable a human being. So  if you go ahead and accept that human beings can handle this  then you move right into fantasy  and as I said  a ballet of violence. Choreographed as are most martial arts movies  it works as a meandering blood portrait  a Jackson Pollock of gore. Numbers mean nothing. One person defeats an army. The army simply widens the landscape and the dance continues. Is there anyone in this movie we care about. I can't think of one. Enlighten me. Everything escalates and we are left with one last part of the ballet.Pardon my naiveté  but the people who love this stuff--why? What is it in you that makes you gravitate toward it? I know I'm an old fogie  but it's easy to see why we don't care what happens to people in war. We feed ourselves a constant diet of this. The violence on the streets continues. ""A Clockwork Orange"" predicted this culture a long time ago and  look around  we have met the enemy and he is us. I suppose that every movie is looked at as art. Even the wost filmmakers call themselves artists (musicians seem to always do this)  and there's little question that Quentin Tarantino has an incredible camera eye.

Now  action is usually not my favorite genre at all  but there is so much more to it. But let us start from the beginning. The writer and director is Quentin Tarantino and at 110 minutes  this one is much shorter than his more recent works. However  you could of course also see this one and the sequel as one movie and then it would be a 4-hour watch. I am truly surprised this film here did not score any Academy Award nominations  especially in categories such as Cinematography  Art Direction or Costume. It's top-notch in these areas and same goes for Thurman as lead actress. I am generally not even a big fan of her really  but she was amazing in this one. At least the Globes and BAFTAs did not overlook her.This movie actually starts with the ending of the film if we take a chronological look at it with The Bride vs. Vernita. We even see in her list that she had already killed O-Ren at this point. But that is not a problem at all. This film is not about if she will succeed  but how she will succeed. We all know she won't be stopped on her path to revenge. We probably already know as well that she will kill the other guys on her list in the sequel. This was pretty interesting as the division in chapters made this a very clean-structured film  but the non-chronology messed things up again. Pretty smart move by Tarantino. I am usually more a fan of chronological films  but here it works very nicely  especially on rewatches.It's obvious Tarantino had a great time making this movie. not only was he working with his muse Uma Thurman  but he could also make this a tribute to all the films and genres he loves being a film nerd himself. And there are some pretty gimmicky scenes occasionally  such as O-Ren's last words and camera shot  the one in which the Bride sends the young fighter back to his mother or when she acts really dumb before disclosing her real intention with Hanzo or the Charlie Brown joking. There are really quite a few memorable characters in here. It's not just the Bride  it's also O-Ren  Sofie Fatale  Gogo Yubari and others... This should also put an end to those criticisms saying Tarantino is not good at writing female characters.The heart and soul of the film is probably the entire chapter featuring O-Ren. Everything before is good too: Vernita  the church scenes  the hospital scenes... but the Asian part of this movie is the best and the snow fight sequence at the end is a thing of beauty. Tarantino also truly managed to go out on a high note with which he made people very curious about the 2nd Kill Bill movie. I quite like that one too (and I will certainly review it at some point)  even if probably not as much as I enjoy the first. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is a mesmerizing watch: great characters  excellent story and a blessing in terms of visuals. Highly recommended.",positive

When she wakes-up  she looks for payback and prepares a list of persons that must die. The first one to be killed is O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and then Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox).

The story is presented in a non-chronological way  and the reasons of the massacre have not been presented yet. In Brazil  only last week `Kill Bill Vol. 1' was released in the movie theaters. I saw it in an imported DVD and I really liked it. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Kill Bill',positive

She compiles a list and sets out after the first person on her list  Tokyo crime boss O-Ren Ishii.On the wave of to-be-expected hype comes Tarantino's latest film  and what a very mixed bag it is indeed.  The decision to split it into two parts is probably for the best for audiences who may not be able to cope with this for three hours plus  but it may also weaken the film in a way that I can't be sure of until I see Volume II. I enjoyed the film  and let me stress that for I know many seem to treat Tarantino's films as a `you're either for us or agin us' issue  but I have some issues with it.In terms of style  it is faultless. Whether it be the camera gliding over the tops of rooms or using black and white and animation to interesting effect.  In fact the opening of the film is so powerful that I actually jumped in my seat as The Bride's opening line was cut short.  However the emphasis on style has lost sight of any meaningful substance.  I hope that Volume II will bring this to the table and not just do more of the same  if it doesn't then this is a weak film  if it does then it should work as a whole.  I found it ironic that the only part of the film that became emotionally involving was the animated back story of O-Ren Ishii  ironic that the cartoon section should hold more substance than the main film. While I realise that we will discover much more in Volume II I still found it hard to keep with a film that was only interested in giving me visual stimulation.Speaking of visual stimuli  the fight scenes are clever and impressive. The total lack of CGI is refreshing and the wire work looks natural and never goes totally OTT.  My favourite scene is in the blacked out room in the House of Blue Leaves  a scene that lacks the gore but is visually uncluttered and stylish.  The gore does get a bit tiresome and some of it was meant to be shocking but little of it is (unless this is your first movie!).  One thing that bothered me in the cinema was some viewers feeling they had to laugh during the fight  as if Tarantino can only do violence if it is darkly funny in some way?!The list of homage's etc come thick and fast.  At times it works well (Sonny Chiba's comic relief chapter) but at other points it is so heavy and self aware that it is almost a spoof of the genre rather than a part of it.  The opening title cards before the film are quite clever but when Tarantino gives up his own style in favour of aping others then it is a bit much. Likewise the Rza's score is mixed in the same way.  At times his music is perfect  keeping the mood without losing his own style  at others the music is almost a lift from other films and it feels like a spoof.The cast are good despite not having much to work with in terms of characterisation or dialogue.  Thurman is strong and holds the attention  Liu is impressive but her character is at her most interesting when in anime form.  Carradine manages to be larger than life despite us only seeing his hands.  Chiba is a nice comic touch at the start of his scene and Chiaki Kuriyama is cool (despite herself being a walking reference).  Fox  Madsen and Hannah have little to do but will hopefully have more in Volume II.Overall I did quite enjoy the film but I was left a little cold by a mix of lack of substance and total visual onslaught.  It has clever moments and it never let my interest wane but I really would have liked a bit of heart to go along with the vast amount of guts (and limbs) it had.  Will I be there for Volume II?  A fantastic last line from Bill himself ensures that I will be.,negative

Chiaki Kuriyama (of Battle Royale fame) and Sonny Chiba round up a pretty great cast.This first chapter of Kill Bill (which originally was planned as one long movie  but was split up into two) leaves you with quite a few questions. One of them being  what is the name of the main character. It seems to be a big mystery and there was a big fuss about it. We only find out in part 2 if it really was worth it.Jumping a few times in the time-line (past/present)  we get a back story and why Uma is doing what she's doing.

Simple  to the point  and right on target - 'get the ba----rd who f----d me up'. Tarantino pays tribute to a wide array of his favorite influences in the picture  and it's a twist to see him in action parodying martial arts and spaghetti Western flicks of the Seventies with more gore and violence than either of those genres ever offered. Did you notice the cereal box that Copperhead Vernita (Vivica A. Fox) used to stealthily ambush The Bride (Thurman) in her kitchen? - it was Kaboom! How great was that? Tarantino's all over the place with clever nuances like that  in fact he threw in not one  but two references to the Sixties TV cult classic 'Star Trek' with the opening tag line 'Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold'  a favorite Klingon proverb  and later compared Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus) to a female villain from ST. The passage of time only makes these references better for fans who grew up with the same affections as Tarantino himself.Obviously ""Kill Bill"" won't appeal to everyone  but then again  what picture does. The caveat here would be the sheer violence  decapitations and bloodshed done in a matter of fact style  but oddly appropriate for the story. There's also a sick mentality attendant to the character of Buck and the creepiness of The Trucker in The Bride's hospital room  but without them  the pent up years of revenge wouldn't have been as sweet.Of course  much of the story is just too fantastic to be believable  but that's probably beside the point. By going for an over the top sword fight at The House of Blue Leaves  the action justifies itself as relentless and vengeful  satisfying the viewer's desire to see The Bride get her due justice. If anything  Part II does even a better job of fulfilling that goal; together they rank as a couple of the best action revenge flicks ever.",positive

Perhaps if he examined this list  he wouldn't make any mistakes in the future. The one thing Tarantino should definitely not be doing is getting involved with any horror films. ""Hostel""  while not awful  was talked up way too much. And his endorsement for ""Wolf Creek""? I have no idea what he was on to make him think it was a stellar flick.But the list of things he can do well is much longer and we see most of those things in ""Kill Bill"". This is the story of a retired assassin who is attacked on her wedding day  and the entire wedding party is killed. When she wakes up from her coma  she decides to take revenge on the man who did this to her: Bill. Yes  she will kill Bill. Or at least die trying.Things Tarantino does very well: 1. Puts scenes in the wrong order. In ""Kill Bill""  they don't even show her killing her enemies in the correct order. He mastered this in ""Pulp Fiction"" after testing it in ""Reservoir Dogs""  but ""Kill Bill"" really drives home how effective a film can be if you put things in a more climatic order.2. Incidental dialog. Some people  like Richard Linklater or Kevin Smith  can make an entire film of incidental dialog  thus making the dialog essential and not really incidental. Tarantino only puts a pinch here or there  to flavor the film with off-hand cultural references. Remember the Royale with Cheese from ""Pulp Fiction""? You'll find more of that here.3. Senseless violence. If you liked the killings in the other films  you'll love this. The killing is gorier  the body count higher. And the influence of old kung fu films is a nice touch. Personally  I'm a big fan of the blood geysers.4. Music selection. Music played a central role in ""Reservoir Dogs"" (K-Billy's Sounds of the 70s). Again  the music is crucial  giving the film an old-timey feel (with ""Green Hornet"" music  among others). This is very well done  mixing the classic (sword fighting) with the modern (guns).5. Putting people in suits. I can't explain why  but the suits worn in Tarantino films are the best.6. Understanding your traditions. This film references so many more old kung fu films tan I will ever see. Tarantino knows his stuff and sprinkles references all over that most people will never understand. A prominent character  Hattori Hanzo  is actually a real character from other sources and even some of the dialog is a throw-back. This homage is touching and well done.What I'm saying is that if you liked Tarantino before  I suspect you'll be a big fan of this movie. It's dirtier  gorier and more violent. Some scenes are much more crude than in his other films. But Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman are a winning combination  not to mention the flawless Michael Madsen and a well-casted David Carradine.",positive

Even the live fight scenes are like a cartoon  e.g. flying to landings  heads being chopped off  and just as much blood! See it for the violence  its almost hilarious. What also makes it a great film is the multi-genre references. It was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for RZA  Best Special Visual Effects  Best Editing and Best Sound.

That said I really enjoy watching it  from start to finish it is pretty gripping.As I'm sure most people will know by know  Uma Thurman plays ""The Bride""  a former assassin who is left for dead after being shot in the head by Bill  her former boss.The film is not shown in chronological order so when we see her first fight it is actually the second person on her hit-list. We then see in flash back that she has been in a coma for four years and has apparently lost her child. Once she has awakened we are shown a brief history of her first target; the Yakuza boss O-Ren Ishii. This section is animated was made by people who have worked on some of the best known anime films so is understandably quite impressive.Before she can fight O-Ren she must get a new sword from retired sword-smith Hattori Hanzo. Initially he refuses to make it as he had sworn never to make another deadly weapon but as soon as he knows who The Bride is after he not only makes her a new sword but states that it is the best he has ever made.When she finally finds O-Ren she uses her new sword to dispatch a vast number of goons before the climactic fight with O-Ren. Much of the fight sequence is in black and white  I believe this was because the censors might not have likes the screen to be awash with bright red blood. While the scene is obviously violent it is so over the top that it isn't really disturbing.If you want a stylish action film that has plenty of re-watch value then this could be the film for you.

Oh  yes  being a Tarantino film it's going to be stylish mayhem  but there is just too much of it.As in ""Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon"" and subsequent films of that nature  there is a lot of swordplay and flying bodies  floating in the air  doing somersaults and other outrageous physically-impossible feats. That's okay if one doesn't overdo it  but  sadly that's the case here as ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman) literally fights and defeats about 100 guys in one long scene. The violence and lunacy of that scene got tiresome but I give Tarantino credit for one thing: he did that particular segment in black-and-white  which was very cool twist.Also  there was too much Japanese spoken in this film with no subtitles  leaving all English-speaking viewers out in the cold as to what was being said. At least have the courtesy to provide subtitles if you 're going to have that much unexplained dialog.Stick to Kill Bill Vol. II. It summarizes this movie and gives you a much more intelligent and better story overall.",positive

A die-hard of the neo-Western (where Japanese samurai flicks meet the new-fangled Old West) and TV action thrillers  Tarantino is the master of quick  canny scenes of carnage. It gets awfully bloody  but not in the NC-17 way. No  Tarantino is much too cute  and his imitativeness isn't exploitative or schlocky (as much as he might like it to be). He gives showy roles to many fine actors  and Uma Thurman seems to inspire him to new heights. But he also gets easily sidetracked and becomes self-enamored of scenes that don't play  plod along or get too cheeky (as with the opening bit featuring Vivaca A. Fox  which is good but not quite as solid as the rest of the film). ""Vol. 2"" is more story-heavy  and gives the actors better room to emote  but also features lots of outlandishness  sometimes just for the sake of a cheap  quick laugh. The trickery  comic mayhem  wild ambushes and female ass-kicking don't amount to much in retrospect. Both volumes include some lovely moments  successfully lowball comedy  and they refuse to let up  but do they honestly turn the audience on? I felt exhausted instead of keyed-up.

It all depends on how well remixed the source material is. When it comes to the two Kill Bill movies  the multiple references are so dense that there's almost an art to how they come together. And the places they're gathered from are so disparate and non-mainstream  the fact that they've coalesced into a Hollywood blockbuster is pretty amazing.A woman in a wedding dress - who we come to know as the Bride and Black Mamba - lies wounded and possibly dying in a chapel in El Paso  Texas. She's been attacked and left for dead by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. With what may be her final breath  she tells Bill  their leader  that she's pregnant with his child. He responds by shooting her in the head.The film jumps forward four years and the Bride (Uma Thurman  who helped conceive this movie with writer/director Quentin Tarantino) has hunted down one of the Vipers: Copperhead/Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox)  who has now become a homemaker. Our heroine tries to give her target a break and offers to meet her to battle somewhere that her family isn't in the crossfire. She responds by trying to shoot and kill the Bride  who dispatches her easily with a knife to the heart.We go back now those four long years to when the Bride was in a coma. California Mountain Snake/Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah  perfection in this movie) whistles her way through the hallways of a hospital  dressed as a nurse with a matching eyepatch  ready to kill the Bride with a lethal injection. However  Bill decides to cancel the kill order as he finds it dishonorable.The Bride wakes up  realizes she's no longer with child and begins her mission of revenge by killing the hospital worker who's been raping her while she was in a coma. She takes his truck and begins the long journey toward learning how to walk and fight again.The first Viper who is on her kill list is Cottonmouth/O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) who has risen to become the leader of a huge clan of Tokyo Yakuza. As a child  O-Ren's parents were murdered and she spent her early years getting her own revenge.The Bride seeks to have a sword made by Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba!)  who has vowed to never forge a sword again. But after he learns that she wants revenge on his former student Bill  he makes one for her.Tracking O-Ren to the House of Blue Leaves  the Bride - we don't learn her name until the next movie  but you can see it on her plane ticket to Tokyo - wipes out O-Ren's gang  the Crazy 88's and her bodyguard  schoolgirl with a spiked yo-yo Gogo Yubari.She then kills O-Ren and tortures her assistant Sofie Fatale to discover where Bill is. The film ends with Bill speaking to Sofie and asking if the Bride knows that their daughter is alive.This film was Tarantino's attempt to move from the talky fare he was known for and into the action cinema that he loves. The House of Blue Leaves battle took six weeks longer than expected  but that's because it's packed with traditional special effects and stuntwork instead of the CGI we're now used to.Obviously  Kill Bill is inspired by grindhouse cinema  drawing inspiration from the Shaw Brothers  Sergio Leone and Lucio Fulci amongst many others. We've gone in-depth to breakdown the actual films that it takes inspiration from in this article. Trust us - there are so many  sometimes multiple references within one shot!According to Uma Thurman  Tarantino asked her to watch three movies to prepare: The Killer  Coffy and A Fistful of Dollars.Originally intended as one movie  the four-hour runtime was considered too long for filmgoers  so this was split in two separate movies. It's pretty astounding that after all the death and destruction in this film  The Bride only has one kill left in the sequel.Kill Bill reminds me of the Beastie Boys' Paul's Botique. There are hundreds of samples all over that album  which make it a much richer experience if you know where they all come from. But if you don't  you can still dance to it.,positive

QT obviously set out to make a spoof of the martial arts movies of Asia  and did a good job. I really was entertained  and use of the exaggerated spurting of blood when a head or limb was cut off reminded me that the film is not to be taken seriously. Plus  the scene where ""The Bride"" single-swordedly defeated a trained army of perhaps 30 or so martial arts experts was pure ""camp.""Thurman was a great choice to play ""The Bride"". She moves well and has a comedic timing that just works well. Lucy Liu is menacing as O-Ren Ishii. Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and David Carradine as Bill complete the main cast. The whole story  which is secondary to the ""look"" of the picture  is Bill having left ""The Bride"" for dead at her wedding  and after recovery in a hospital  escapes and sets off the kill all those on her list. This first installment shows us how she gets rid of the first half of her list. I guess I will find out about the second half in due time. To be continued ...",positive
395,Kill Bill: Vol. 1,2003,R,1h 51min,Action; Crime; Thriller; ,10 October 2003 (USA),8,970439,2272,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/8cpA3zKXCXtWdW5_JoQwxOGv1zg=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p32988_p_v8_af.jpg,9,an apparently trivial story transcended in a stylish treatment,2006-08-11,"""One of these days  I'm going to cut you into little pieces"" (Pink Floyd  One of These Days  Meddle  1971).I have often written in some reviews on this site that I wasn't a big fan of Quentin Tarantino  a cinema-going filmmaker with a mind-boggling culture. It's true that I have never been very taken with ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). As for ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1""  I had deemed it as ""violent and hollow"". I maintain the first epithet but I jettison the second one now. I watched it again last Saturday night with its other brother ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" (that I hadn't seen before) and I changed my mind about it. I realized that I had overlooked it and I would go as far as saying that I found it much better than Tarantino 1994 film.The staple story doesn't carry much weight. A wedding in the desert takes a tragic dimension when all the guests are killed except the Bride who spends four years in a coma. When she wakes up  she's got one sole word in her mind: revenge. On a scrap of paper  she noted down the names of the ones who made of her wedding a tragedy and is well determined to kill them all. She also keeps the best for the end: Bill. This story is for Tarantino almost a pretext to beef it up with sources coming from different horizons: comic strip  spaghetti western  samurai film and even video games in the elaboration of the fight sequences. And animated by a cinema passion  the filmmaker couldn't resist to the desire to include film-loving details throughout the Bride's adventures. Thus  the title of the second chapter is entitled if my memory serves me well: ""the Bride wore blood"". It's of course a hint at François Truffaut's film  ""la Mariée Etait en Noir"" (1968)  a film on which Truffaut himself didn't have a warm spot. I have just mentioned the term chapter since the film and its companion are divided into chapters and Tarantino isn't afraid of subverting storytelling conventions by showcasing chapters in a chronological disorder like his previous efforts.The technical command of ""Kill Bill: Vol 1."" leaves speechless. First  I would like to congratulate Tarantino for the cinematography he tapped. It enhances bright colors  especially the red and one thing I noticed: in the first sequence of the film  Uma Thurman drives a vehicle with red seats. In Jean-Luc Godard's ""Pierrot Le Fou"" (1965)  the red is also a dominating color. In one scene  Jean Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina are in a car with red seats. If I don't understand at all the symbolical function of the red in Godard's highbrow work  in Tarantino's work  his symbolic is blatant according to the story and the Bride's motivations. Red is revenge  violence  death.This revenge story is filmed with virtuosity to its recesses where nothing is left to chance. It's tempting to deem the introduction of some characters as filler but it's necessary to reveal and consolidate their persona. And throughout these chapters  Tarantino taps all the cinematographic possibilities to bestow and embellish the form to the service of his intentions (to pay homage to the samurai film among others) and the contents. Thus  one of the moments of the film is showcased under the form of a Japanese cartoon film and for perhaps one of the most momentous moments (the scene when the BRie kills some 80 masked enemies  Tarantino borrowed a device from Hitchcock he used in his mind-boggling ""Psycho"" (1960): to shot an incredibly violent fight sequence in black and white not to show the red blood. Besides and while I'm on this sequence as well as the others that involve fights  they are so well choreographed and set with clockwork precision that they can emulate  even outclass the ones of ""the Matrix"" saga. And as many film buffs know it  one of Tarantino's recognizable signs is his pronounced taste for bloody violence. For ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1""  he didn't shelve it but this violence is virtually all blood and thunder and watching ripped or pierced body parts or whole bodies  slashed arms and legs becomes highly great fun. Thrill-seekers will be overjoyed and the height is reached when the Bride before facing Lucy Liu declares to them: ""don't try to get back your missing parts!"".Tarantino even grants some importance to some apparently trivial things like for instance the Japanese man who sells to the Bride a clean saber writes on the mist of a window  the one whom the Bride wants to get rid of at the end of her list (you guessed who it is of course) or when the Bride tries to move her big toe after her coma.It's exciting cinema as one could wish and for Tarantino whose target was partly to pay homage to the samurai movies with which he grew up  he delivered the goods: to spend a truly great cinema moment. The different cinematographic devices and tricks interlock with easiness and fluidity. What about my judgment of the volume 2? The answer in my review about it.NB: there's perhaps this unlikeliness in Tarantino's scenario. When the Bride gets out of the hospital and finds herself in the underground parking  thirteen hours pass by before she can feel her feet again. But during this time the staff at the hospital must have realized her departure. Why don't they find her again after such a long time? It's a minor detail.",negative
396,Kill Bill: Vol. 1,2003,R,1h 51min,Action; Crime; Thriller; ,10 October 2003 (USA),8,970439,2272,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/8cpA3zKXCXtWdW5_JoQwxOGv1zg=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p32988_p_v8_af.jpg,10,Arguably one of the most potent treatises on 'genre' film-making that you'll ever see,2003-10-10,After seeing Kill Bill Volume one tonight I am certain of two things: 1  Quentin Tarantino  mastermind behind Kill Bill as well as the smash hits Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction  is the only filmmaker that can walk the tightrope of doing an unfortunate rip-off and a brilliant homage without falling onto the wrong side. And 2  I agree with his logic now of splitting his epic in two parts  if only because of the climactic battle between The Bride and the Crazy 88 fighters- any attempt to top this within the same time frame of a three hour+ motion picture is ridiculous. By doing so  Tarantino leaves us with one of the most violent (and I mean that as a compliment  since when violence is frowned upon in movies that means it's impressive instead of tongue-in-cheek like in horror films)  visceral  and definitely entertaining films of the year. After seeing it once  to which I'll probably see it again  I can say that it's my favorite movie-going experience of the year.The Bride  her nickname in the group Black Mamba  is killed off (or so they thought) by her fellow partners in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. When she awakes from her coma four years later  she regains her consciousness of what she must do- kill the four partners  and then her boss Bill (played by the immediately recognizable  if only by voice  David Carradine). In volume one she goes after Vernita Green (Copperhead)  and O-Ren Ishi (Cottonmouth)  and like in Tarantino's past efforts the story is told in a non-linear style that gives answers first  questions later. But these story elements are  unlike his past films  just little details. Even to those who won't like Kill Bill and I know they have their understandable reasons - for Americans this will be one of the most violent films they may ever see  and for marital arts/kung-fu fans on Asia this will be something standard  however in parody. But the violence is done with the message that it's all stylized  and that Kill Bill is a triumph of style over substance is a compliment the haters may feel poking at them (I'd say though that kids under the age of 12 and character-study film buffs should stay clear of this one). As an avid film-goer  I found that there was so much to soak up in Kill Bill that at the least it contained some of Tarantino's most daring direction  taking chances that paid off  and borrowing to the point of a true transcendence of the material.One thing I love in a movie  personally  is when certain images or scenes stay in my head long after the film is over  and there are a few in this one that are still buzzing in my head as I write this commentary. The climax is impressive  yet the sequence that had me completely riveted was the Japanese anime sequence detailing the background on O-Ren Ishi. Like much of the rest of the film  it has bloodshed  intense close-ups  and quick editing. But there was just something about this whole sequence  the emotion that came through it. I'd have to say it's one of Tarantino's finest moments (and equal credit goes to whoever directed the animation  which ranks second to Toyoo Ashida  director of the classic Fist of the North Star)  right up there with the overdose in Pulp Fiction and the opening in Reservoir Dogs. In fact  I also think an equal amount of praise should be given to cinematographer Robert Richardson  contributing heavily to Q.T.'s vision  and his usual editor Sally Menke for putting it all together. Kill Bill volume one accomplishes what it was hyped for- it's a spectacular showcase for devourers of grind-house cinema (while I've never seen any grind-house films  surprising I know  I felt I had seen so much of the genre in this one effort) and for Tarantino's main fan base. And while it is often assumed his fan base if mostly comprised of some film buffs and a lot of guys who like guy-action-movies  having Uma Thurman  Vivica A. Fox  and Lucy Liu (who all contribute great fight/stunt work by the way) turns Kill Bill into something of a chick flick as well.,negative

Kill Bill is  without any doubt  the coolest film I've seen in a long  long time. It's more than just a film; it's a truly refreshing experience and an almost complete encyclopedia for cinema buffs to admire. How can you tell a dreadful  déjà-vu tale of revenge and still look innovating and original? Only QT knows the answer to this He saw the change to extend a seemly repetitive plot (a woman awakes after a 4 year coma and avenges herself) with loads of tributes to `dead' film-genres  such as Martial Arts-movies  exploitation and Spaghetti-westerns. The results of this are absolutely amazing and Kill Bill is a film to watch over and over again  without EVER growing tired off. On the contraryit'll only get better with repeated viewings. The characters are typically Tarantino  which means delightfully eccentric and criminally insane. The main characters are the very ingenious `Deadly Viper Assassination Squad'  led by Bill who's given image to by David Carradine! He's a 70's Kung-Fu legend and Tarantino more or less did the same for him as he did for John Travolta and Pam Grier. Some of the side-characters are highly memorable as well. Gogo  for example! She's a 17-year-old schoolgirl who makes up in madness what she lacks in age. Kill Bill contains less memorable dialogues than previous QT films  but this is widely made up by an overload of terrifically over-the-top violence. The absolute highlights to this being a grotesque finale and a brilliant Manga-tribute. I simply can't give enough praise to this film. If you like cinema and all of its history  you'll love Kill Bill and that's all there is to it. Every tiny detailed aspect about this movie is worth mentioning. From Daryl Hannah's eye lap with a little red cross on it to the extravagant Pussy Mobiel.  And than I haven't even talked about the brilliant soundtrack!!,positive

This denotes what is wrong about this film  indeed why Tarantino is to film as Brittany Spears is to music.Martial arts are about generational wisdom  about the rigidity of the masters all the way back empowering new freedom all the way forward. When a fight occurs  it is not the weapons that are in combat  not even the combatants: it is the respective masters who operate through time and space. Ang Lee understood this when he made his film  one that could reliably called an homage.This is something else  wholly Americanized. Here we have a setup that is from cold war 60's culture  a themed assassination squad. The focus is on the individual. When Uma's character fights  it is in the Eastwood/Segal tradition. This is Yankee individualism filtered through episodic TeeVee and only then cloaked in B-movie style.
For all this to work  we have to have a God. Can be the noir god of detached fate; can be the Hitchcock/dePalma god of the camera; can be the Lynch god of the filmmaker's angst; can be the Leone god of irony  or the Fellini god of parallel dreams  or Medem of animated orgasm  or Bergman of the Judge. Our man Q wants them all  and has to cut each of them to make room for the others. He is not clean and focused like Kurosawa  but jumbled like Rob Zombie.`Once Upon a Time in Mexico' has identical aspirations  but Rodriguez steeps us in something he actually knows  leverages an actor that actually understands irony (not some second rater; remember Mrs Peel and Poison Ivy?)  clearly identifies his god/ observer (Depp)  and does it all himself: writing  directing  shooting  editing  composing. In comparison  Quentin is a novice and this is a dim conversation in a lonely corner of an effete Hollywood party.As in all of life  there are two kinds of people in film. I'll call them engineers and scientists. Engineers work with known vocabularies and principles. They take insights of others and tinker about with different combinations to accomplish certain practical goals. There is an imagination of sorts  but it extends only so far as understanding the storehouse of components supplied by others. The scientists go where no one else has ever gone  into the void and bring back new reality that they convince us to accept. Which of these you choose for your life in film could determine everything about you  because you live in your imagination. Compare `Ghost Dog' (or even `Pillow Book') to `Kill Bill.' Both are about themselves  cast in terms of what went before. One is subtle  even elusive in its truths. Possibly  it is only one of many stories it is about as the little girl within it reads. The other  `Bill' is already chewed for you. Brittany Spears. They even use the same musician as composer. One is subtle and rich  the other a jukebox.Kurosawa is a scientist; Tarantino a shopkeeper  and that brings me to my final point. Quentin does have terrific storytelling skills. But look at how they are used. All of his attention goes to explaining what happened before  including the trademarkedtimefolds. This is very well done and completely comprehendible. But good storytelling  the really good stuff  is about what happens NEXT. See any of that here?Nope  just sugared breakfast cereal.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",positive

Think an amalgamation of chop-socky  sexploitation  samurai  spaghetti Westerns  anime and cop shows of years past  and you get the heart of Kill Bill. A film that was so epic in scope it had to be cut into two films. What it lacks in Tarrantino dialogue dynamite it more than makes up for with action and astute visual flair. And it's bloody  very bloody. Thurman is great as the avenging Mamba/The Bride  while the inclusion of Sonny Chiba & Lucy Liu adds a touch of class as QT revels in his East meets West berserker narrative. It could have been trimmed down  particularly in the middle section where Tarrantino deals in a calm before the storm ideal  but Volume 1 was one of the most exciting movies of 2003  and most notably it shows Tarrantino to be adept at action directing.

Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made  and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality  it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.Here in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects  they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all  here the effects are stunning  the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully  maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film.  and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron  and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.Terminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts  more so than the original  while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense  without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth  the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun  beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.Linda Hamilton gives another terrific performance  that is more depth than her performance in the first film  Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.In conclusion  a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original  and the only one that's above good level. For me  if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal  in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Obviously that reputation has long since been diminished by films which have come since  but I still remember the hype and excitement that surrounded this film when I was but a ten year old boy. Containing Arnold Schwarzenegger's most accessible  likable performance  it's difficult to find fault with this near-masterpiece of adrenaline-pumping action.Essentially it's just a string of set pieces linked together by a few scenes of dialogue. There's little drama or acting involved - all the characters are clear-cut - basically  the film goes from one outstanding action sequence to another. And these action scenes are truly wonderful. There are five in all; each more exciting and meaningful than the last. The first comes when the T-800 and T-100 finally meet up and have a huge battle in a hallway  smashing walls down and throwing each other through windows. The battle of the titans continues outside in a riveting truck chase  stopped only by a huge explosion. The third suspenseful set-piece shows just how unstoppable the T-1000 is  as the goodies and baddies battle over rescuing Sarah Connor from her mental asylum. Then there's lot of gunfire and explosions in the Cyberdyne building siege  until the final climatic battle between good and evil at a steel mill.If THE ABYSS was the first film to really introduce CGI  TERMINATOR 2 is the first film to really make use of its facilities and to place them in a context - unlike later entries which tried to make non-computerised things look real  and failed. The T-1000's morphing shots are stunning  show-stopping  and exceptional  and they work because they are meant to look as such. Aside from these excellent morphing sequences (the scene involving the T-1000 coming out of a floor is probably the greatest)  there's tons of ammunition and explosions flying across the screen at every opportunity. Arnie dons some realistic ""wound"" makeup in the final scenes of the film  and once again the makeup is flawless. The special effects are the best things in this film; the makeup  CGI work and stunts all come together in absolute perfection.The performance are spot on too; characters are introduced and are made charismatic  but thankfully are not dwelled upon. Edward Furlong makes an impressive debut as the streetwise  foul-mouthed kid who has a heart of gold  while Linda Hamilton has undergone a complete transformation from her victimised waitress in the first film to a muscular  lean killing machine herself. Robert Patrick helped to carve himself a niche for playing evil psychopaths  and his slim figure goes well with the morphing capabilities he possesses - he looks like a match for Arnie. But it's our friend Schwarzenegger who steals the film  starting out as a cold  calculating machine and in the end sacrificing himself for mankind. That this finale had me bursting into tears on more than one occasion shows just how good Arnie is in it. He's funny  heroic  likable and consistently impressive - what more could you want? Other familiar faces fill out the supporting cast  with the likes of Xander Berkeley and Earl Boen (returning from the first film) in minor roles.The violence isn't skirted  either...lots of people get impaled by the T-1000's knife-arms  plenty of men get shot in the knees (ouch)  Arnie even cuts the skin off his own arm at one point. But this is primarily an action film  and should be treated as such. Every scene is flawlessly composed  with some little neat ideas thrown in almost everywhere - everything is portrayed coolly and stylishly  especially where Arnie is concerned. He really is the king of cool here - from the flick as he puts on his sunglasses to the shotgunning open of locked gates in split seconds to his final catchphrases - ""Hasta la Vista baby"" and ""I'll be back"" to name but two. And still there's more to praise: a moral behind the story  a suspenseful score  excellent opening titles  no lulls in the film whatsoever  nice photography  crisp editing...the list is  indeed  endless. In my youth  this was my most-watched film  and I can still watch it over without ever becoming bored. A masterpiece  plain and simple  and one of my very favourite films.",positive

I'll go a step further and say this here is one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made. It's funny but I still have vivid memories of watching this on opening night even though I was only eleven-years-old. I remember the buzz going into the movie. I remember who I watched it with and I can even remember what part of the theater I was sitting in. At the time I don't think I fully realized how special the film I was watching was because I only saw it as something extremely cool with ground breaking effects. Today I see the film as a complete masterpiece of film-making even though one might find a few logical issues but then again this is science fiction so the logic could be overlooked anyways. I think it goes without saying but the story is the best thing going on here. The plot is a very simple one: the prevention of Judgment Day so what else do you need? The movie has Arnold Schwarzenegger returning and giving the greatest performance of his career. Linda Hamilton is also back and the way she transformed her character from the first film is pretty remarkable. Edward Furlong makes for a very good John Connor and Robert Patrick is terrific as the villain. The special effects were ground breaking in 1991 and I might say they haven't been topped in all the years since. Sure  CGI has come along but they can't hold up to anything in this movie. The liquid metal is pure genius and all the effects are masterfully done. You could pick any single one of them and hold it up as being some of the best ever created. Whereas the first film was extremely dark  this one here allows for the Terminator to have more character development and I think this was a great thing to do. Just as it was great to have Frankenstein's monster speak in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN  I think it's great to show a more humor Terminator. The jokes work perfectly and you can't help but find the ending very touching. No matter which version you watch (I prefer the theatrical) this is a marvelous film that has perfectly stood the test of time and delivers itself as one of the greatest of its type.,positive

It's mimetic poly-alloy material allow it to mimic anything it touches. John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest  it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor  and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create. All of it makes this more than a simple shoot 'em up movie. This is one of the best sequel ever.,positive

I haven't seen the picture since then until tonight  and even though it's twenty years later I'm still blown away by the special effects of the picture. The liquid metal alloy concept of Robert Patrick's T-1000 makes for a lot of clever mutations  with each one outdoing the one that went before. The one that really got me was when he rose out of the black and white tile floor of the hospital corridor. Very cool.Story wise  I always have a little trouble with these time travel gimmicks. It seems to me that Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) understood the unintended consequences of his work with Cyberdyne  and the science that came out of the remnants of the 1984 Terminator were handily disposed of at the finale. So Arnold and Company effectively saved the present day AND the future  except that the future happened anyway. I may be missing something here  but I'm not going to dwell on it.What I probably like most about the story is the relentless nature of the T-1000 to complete his mission  and the equal resolve that the Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 (that would be Arnie) has to stop him. Schwarzenegger once again parlayed his ability to deliver just a single line that has since become iconic - ""Hasta la vista  Baby""  getting by the rest of the way with his huge physique and a singular scowl. To her credit  Linda Hamilton literally got in shape for this picture by getting totally buffed  making her action sequences that much more believable. I'd probably be remiss if I didn't mention Edward Furlong for his portrayal as the young John Connor. I didn't really care for him at the start of the picture  but he grew into the role as the story progressed  becoming a sympathetic character by the time it was over.",negative

In ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""  Sarah goes all bad-ass to protect her son John (Edward Furlong  in an impressive debut). Oh  and of course there's the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) battling the villainous T-1000 (Robert Patrick)  sent back in time to kill John.Okay  so ""T2"" goes a little overboard on special effects  but it does manage to have a plot. The threat of a nuclear holocaust is always unnerving. Obviously  sending someone back in time to change history violates the paradox of time travel (meaning that if you change the past  then the future will be completely different  so there would be no incentive to change the past to begin with)  but this is a pretty good movie  as action flicks go. Among other things  it shows that when Ah-nuld tries  he can act.",positive

Terminator. Movie. Ever.,2007-07-26,"I'm not even going to bother with a real review of this film  because it has like 4000 other reviews and most people know what it is even if they haven't seen it. Sarah Conner's in an insane asylum  and a robot from the future has come to kill her son. But don't worry  because her son (in the future) sent his own robot back to kill the other robot and save the son (himself). Yeah  it might not make sense from a time travel point of view  but just deal with it.What to say? Arnold is great  as usual (though this is no ""Commando""). Edward Furlong is young  but does a fine job. I don't have the crush on him some people do  but he's cool. Robert Patrick is also awesome  even if he has creepy weird ears. And this is more action than you'll get in most films  which is probably what you want if you're watching this.There  that was my little review.

The T-1000 is nothing like the original; it is a liquid metal machine  able to change its form to look like anyone or anything of the same volume. To protect John the resistance and reprogrammed a captured T-800 Terminator and sent it back to defend him.When the film starts John is living with foster parents and his mother is in a secure mental institution still convinced that Skynet will destroy civilisation in 1997. The T-800 manages to save John from the T-1000 then  on John's orders helps Sarah escape. Once out she knows what must be done; they must find the man responsible for the creation of the technology behind Skynet and prevent him from finishing his work all the time staying ahead of the T-1000.Even though this film was made a quarter of a century ago the special effects still look very impressive and there is a lot of exciting and spectacular action there are shootouts  a truck vs bike chase along on of Los Angeles's concrete rivers  explosions and final chase involving trucks and a helicopter. Those who want action should certainly be pleased on the other hand it does feel a bit safe at times; John orders the T-800 never to kill making it like a defanged cobra; scary looking but no longer deadly. Arnold Schwarzenegger continues to impress in the role  managing to inject some humour into the character. Linda Hamilton is also pretty solid as Sarah Connor; it is interesting to see how much her character has developed since the original. Edward Furlong is okay as the young John Connor although his character can be a bit irritating at times in a way that didn't seem real. Robert Patrick did a fine job as the shapeshifting T-1000. The level of violence is considerably lower than the original; the T-1000 kills a few people but even when blasting away with a minigun the T-800 only destroys property and causes non-life-threatening injuries this of course means the film is suitable for a slightly younger audience. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the original; personally I prefer the first film but I can understand why others would rate this one higher.,positive

I enjoyed all three of the ""Terminator"" films but this one has always stood out.....because of the villain and the incredible special-effects. When this movie came out  the FX regarding Robert Patrick's cyborg-patrol cop were so jaw- dropping  so astounding that people couldn't believe what they were seeing. Some 15 years later  they are still cool. Watching Patrick morph into various characters is incredible  literally changing shapes or having his fingers or arms extend to an awl-like instruments. For a long time  he looks like the most indestructible ""person"" I've ever seen in a film. He certainly is still one of the most unique villains ever shown on film.Arnold Schwarzenegger  an intelligent but less-advanced cyborg  plays the only likable character. The mother-son combination of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are too hard-edged  too smart-mouthed for my tastes. Hamilton was a lot more feminine and humanistic in the first ""Terminator."" Now she's ultra-macho and profane. Much worse than her is her kid  a real punk if there ever was one. There's something very irritating about Furlong  and not just the character he plays here. I'm not surprised he never became a star. Actually  a lot of the dialog in here is terrible and a testimony to the sleazy people who wrote the screenplay. The director  James Cameron  has done a number of similar films with foul- mouthed characters. Still  despite all these annoyances  as a fan of special-effects and a good adventure yarn  I can't help but keep watching this DVD every three or four years.",positive

Almost.Director James Cameron went in a somewhat very deviant direction with this sequel movie. And in my opinion he strayed a bit too much from the original storyline. Sure it was cool to see the T-1000 cyborg and its liquid metal ability  but at the same time having the T-800 model sent back to protect Sarah Connor's child was an odd twist of events for me.That being said  I am not saying that ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a bad or poor movie  far from it. Because this movie is action-packed and fast paced from start to end. I just personally didn't like the switch of roles all too keenly.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles quite well  carrying on from the original movie. I can't claim to be overly much a fan of Edward Furlong  so in my opinion he wasn't the best of choices for the role. Robert Patrick  however  he was really well-cast for the role of the T-1000.The effects in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" were quite good  and the effects with the T-1000 were rather groundbreaking back then in 1991. And the special effects really helped the movie along quite nicely  because they added a level of believability to the movie.All in all then ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is an entertaining action movie.

The original was a masterful piece of low-budget film-making; with a much bigger budget and the latest special effects technology at his disposal  Cameron's sequel was a must-see.It didn't disappoint.Twenty years later: even though film-making technology has advanced in leaps and bounds over the last two decades  and budgets have got bigger and bigger  very few movies have provided me with as many perfectly executed cinematic thrills as T2.

Not only does the film deliver everything you could want in terms of explosive entertainment  but it also has some wonderful humour and a lot of heart—and anyone who says otherwise can eat me!,positive

I mean  this IS the movie where the end of the world has the most impact outside of Dr. Strangelove  right? One of those outstanding dream scenes in movies  one of the ones that actually works because it's true in its savage simplicity  Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor sees herself in her 1984 waitress get up with baby John in a playground and then everything gets wiped out by the BIG BOMB (Dmitri) that also incinerates Hamilton into BBQ.So it's with this kind of thought that Terminator 2 means to be the most kick-assingest blockbuster of its (or all?) time while trying to keep the loss of life very small - or  rather  the ""Bad"" Terminator who was designed by the wizards at ILM can kill to its mission's content - I mean  DAMN  it still looks great  and in its silver-liquid-chrome simplicity much more  for me  impressive than the clanging junk of Bay disasters. It's arguable  of course  that the Terminator (T-800) does kill some people  incidentally  or  you know  all that gas from the gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but  hey  ""He'll live"" is enough.But if Cameron is ""soft"" at all here  it doesn't show too much... well  okay  Lil' John (hehe) does squeak and squak those early 90's amorphisms ""No Problemo - chill out - listen to Kriss Kross - etc""  and Edward Furlong is one of the things that just does not hold up here. He's serviceable at best  annoying at worst. He can cry okay though.But it's Arnold  in his swaggering low-key and then with an occasional grin awesome leading man turn  and especially Linda Hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable. Hamilton makes Connor into what Cameron likely saw in his one-time wife/collaborator Bigelow - a take-no-prisoners soldier who can take charge and has muscles and can probably knock you upside the head (maybe that's why they divorced  he couldn't take all that woman... but I digress  at any rate he moved around a lot till his current wife) And there is also a vulnerability still to Sarah that makes her so endearing. She can never be completely hard  though time and experience and the dread of what's to come had scarred her  so by the time she has the chance to kill the Man Who Destroys The World  she can't do it. A scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try in these blockbusters (something like Days of Future Past  which is a cousin of this flick  gets there). The fact Hamilton wasn't able to parlay such high caliber performance work into a better career is kind of sad  but at least this stands as a benchmark of a woman action hero  one of the two Cameron Wonder Women really.So  blast your Guns N Roses  say hi to the kid from Salute Your Shorts (that's him  right  Connor's friend in the first act?) and ride your motorcycle through LA - it's a bad mother-jammer of a blockbuster that holds up enough to look over its faults (i.e. some dialog isn't tight  like the voice-over  it's alright but whatever - perhaps it was ambitious enough to best The Perfect Action Movie  which the first Terminator just was).",positive

Hollywood decides to make lots of money by making a sequel to a classic genre film while ignoring the elements that made the original so brilliant.Take the script for example   THE TERMINATOR had one of the most tightly written scripts I can think of . The sequel is very flabby and mechanical especially in the middle where the fugitives escape to the desert. On top of that it`s very poor SF   if ten years have passed since the first film then that also means that ten years have passed in the future but as the original pointed out Cyberdyne systems had been beaten by the humans so how could they send another   superior terminator back to 1994 ?THE TERMINATOR worked so well because it was well made and written   not because it had an army of stuntmen or FX wizards. This seems to have slipped the producers memories. Here we are treated to explosions   stunts   FX   car chases  FX    explosions   helicopter chases   FX   explosions  FX  more explosions and a nuclear war featuring - you`ve guessed it - FX and explosions. The morphing FX might have been groundbreaking in 1991 but two years later every pop video   advert and TV title sequence had done the effect to death which means in a space of four or five years T2 looked extremely dated .My final gripe is down to the dubious morality of it all. Big Arnie goes around blowing the kneecaps off a whole SWAT team . Is it really necessary for him to do this ? I mean he is a terminator so bullets can`t hurt him so why`s he dishing out maimings ?I see there`s a TERMINATOR 3 in the pipeline. I predict it`ll be the biggest flop in years,positive

I'm not exactly sure  but I believe T2 was the first movie to use CGI. One thing is for sure  they were certainly the first film to use CGI successfully. They brought to screen only what minds could imagine when they introduced the shape-shifting T-1000 Terminator.T2 already had a set base as a story in the success of Terminator. T2 only built upon that success and made sure to one-up its predecessor. Besides the CGI there were some excellent shots and excellent scenes. Just to name a few: when T800 (Schwarzenegger) rescues John Connor on the motorcycle  the amazing slow-mo scene when Sarah Connor attempts to escape the hospital only to come face to face with the T800  and the fight scene between the T800 and the T1000 (Robert Patrick).T2 was a trend setter and a trailblazer  even other movies adopted abbreviating their title. The action was just right. Not too much  not too little  and not over the top to make you think  ""Absolutely impossible."" T2 was very well directed  as it had to be to overcome the poor acting of the three lead actors. It was an instant classic that will continue to be referenced forever.",positive

Writer & director James Cameron has outdone himself with this follow-up film to his seminal sci-fi  time travel  yarn about men and machines. In the original  a Cybernetic organism classified a Terminator appeared from the future to execute Sarah Connor  while the mankind resistance army of the future dispatched a warrior back to 1984 to save Sarah from certain death. Kyle Reese showed up and helped Sarah kill the Terminator. Nevertheless  although our heroine managed to survive the nightmarish ordeal and have a baby before she hightailed it to Mexico  Cyberdyne Systems acquired the forearm of the Terminator that she killed in the machine press and Sarah eventually wound up locked away in custody at the Pescadero Mental Hospital. Miraculously  Sarah's ten-year son John Connor (Edward Furlong in his first role) has been farmed out to foster parents  Janelle (Jenette Goldstein) and Tod Voight (Xander Berkeley)  but is living the life of a low-grade hoodlum ripping off automated teller devices at banks when another Terminator designated a T-1000 (Robert Patrick) shows up to kill him. Unlike the enemy Terminator in ""The Terminator "" the T-1000 is a highly advanced model that consists of liquid metal and can alter its shape. Essentially  the T-1000 is far more formidable than the earlier Terminators  and it gives our heroes a run for their money. As it turns out  the Resistance has rewired a T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger of ""Red Sonja"") and sent him back to 1995 to protect John. The outcome is a thoroughly exciting action thriller that raises the stakes where the villainous Terminators are concerned. Cameron and co-writer William Wisher have supplemented the plot with some humor as young John Connor helps the Terminator fit into society by saying familiar phrases. The T-1000 is a truly menacing adversary for our heroes and they have to keep on blasting away at it because it can repair itself in no time. As Sarah Connor  Linda Hamilton has undergone a transformation from being a vulnerable waitress to being a lean  mean doll who fights the Terminator. Initially  when John and the T-101 show up at the mental asylum  they have to battle the T-1000 and escape by the hair of their chin. You won't find a better sci-fi actioneer than ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day "" and some of the dialogue is funny.",positive

That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake. What I'm referring to is that going by the first  it technically shouldn't exist. I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series(I've experienced many who  with good cause  deny there to be a third movie... heck  I am one of them)  but I could see why there could be. However  if you look past that(and you ought to at least consider doing so  as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success)  you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience. The plot is interesting and well-told. The pacing is solid. The acting is great from all  Patrick is an incredible addition  and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role. The action gets bigger  and still consists of fights  shootouts and car chases  all of which are marvelous and exciting  and never degenerates into stupidity. The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled. Really cool. The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out. The science fiction remains well-done. This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character(though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort). While some of the dark tone is maintained  it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece. There is also no nudity(well  just about) or sexuality in this. I have more points against this  meanwhile  they all give stuff away  and this will remain a spoiler-free review. And even with them  it's hard to argue with the quality of this  even if you prefer The Terminator to it(and I do). I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi  intense scenes  James Cameron  the others who made this  and/or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid. 10/10,positive

Well  forgive me for nit picking  but I didn't think the humour is as strong as it was in New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Plus  while it was evident  the romantic elements weren't as developed either. However  putting these flaws aside  it is still enormously entertaining  thanks to the elaborate set pieces and the well choreographed battles(the final battle especially was a knockout). And I will say that it is a vast improvement over the prequels. The plot is still fast paced and sophisticated  and the screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever.I have heard many complaints about the Ewoks. I think it depends on your perspective whether you like them or not; maybe a delight to younger audiences  maybe too sickly cute to an adult. Being a 17 year old female  I thought they were very cute. The acting is still very impressive  with Mark Hamill spontaneously likable in the lead. Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda and his death scene is heart rending  and Ian McDairmund also steals his scenes as the Emperor. Harrison Ford  in an inspired bit of casting is great again as Han Solo  Carrie Fisher is still vivacious and Alec Guiness the great actor that he was is brilliant as Obi Wan. But my favourite is James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader  his majestic booming voice is very ideal for a dark menacing villain. And I must mention John Williams's music  brilliant and innovative  unquestionably one of the best film scores of all time. All in all  while my least favourite of the original trilogy  Return of the Jedi makes for essential viewing. 9/10 Bethany Cox.,negative

The story of Han Solo's rescue from Jabba The Hut and then the final confrontation with the Empire should have been two films. That would have been double the pleasure for fans of the series. As it stands now the folks there in that galaxy far away are in a happy ever after ending of their saga.The same old familiar faces from Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back are with us again. Harrison Ford was betrayed by Billy Dee Williams to the Empire who turned him over to Jabba  but the others affect an escape helped by the selfsame Billy Dee who did not like being reduced to a hireling in what was his former planet.Mark Hamill as the budding Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker learns the true nature of his existence and of the temptation to go over to the dark side of the Force. The path of light might be rougher  but it does not carry the same burdens. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia finally chooses between Hamill and Harrison  although the script kind of makes the choice for her.George Lucas when he made additional films opted for the prequel showing how the situation came to be in the galaxy far away. He could still do a sequel  but unless he does this is it for the beloved characters of Star Wars.Return Of The Jedi got several Oscar nominations in technical categories all richly deserved. Something tells me we haven't seen the last of these people and the other creatures of their galaxy.,negative

In fact  it's another very good entry in the series and for the most part it's a nice way to end the original trilogy. This film  once again  tries to be even bigger than the previous one  which it is in many ways but at the same time there's no denying that you start to feel the 134 minute running time.Still  there are so many great moments here that you can't help but get caught up in everything going on. You've got Hamill  Fisher  Billy Dee Williams and Ford all in top-gear and they obviously deliver strong performances. Chewbacca is back and naturally steals every scene that he's in. The action scenes are some of the best of the series with the stuff in outer space looking 100% authentic but we also get some fun stuff on land including the aircraft race through the forest.Yoda  R2-D2 and C-3PO are all return but we're also introduced to the Ewoks. It seems fans are split on how ""good"" they are. I'm sure kids loved seeing these little creatures and while I won't deny they're cute  at the same time I'm not sure how much they add.

It was made 6 years after the original and was the first that did not win any Oscars  but still scored 4 nominations. Fans of the possibly biggest franchise in film history often consider this one the weakest from the 3 early films  but I cannot agree with this sentiment. It may even be my favorite from the trio. They included many interesting new characters  elaborated nicely on the old ones and there is one of the most famous villains in film history in here. The locations are fairly great to watch as well.The film is pretty long  runs for roughly 135 minutes  but there was rarely a moment when I felt it dragged and to me it also seemed as if most of the actors have stepped up their games by 1983. George Lucas only appears as writer in here and the director is Richard Marquand  probably not a name known to too many outside the Star Wars universe. Unlucky for him  he also died way too early. But I think he did a fairly memorable job here. What I liked the most about his film here are probably all the colorful  memorable characters  especially the cute furry ones.But the film also delivers on the dramatic side  especially in terms of Yoda and in terms of tragedy involving core characters. And for the great sci-fi lovers  there are also many great locations in space and spectacular special effects sequences. I am not one of the latter  which is also why I only give the film a ***/*****  but this should not keep you from watching this one here  especially if you are bigger on the genre than I am. Fun watch. Go check it out.",positive

A good film but weak by comparison with the two before,2002-06-30,Han Solo has been captured by Jabba the Hutt  but C3P0 and R2D2 come to rescue him with some other help too.  Once free from Jabba  Han joins with the Rebels to prepare to launch an attack on an all new Death Star being produced.  Luke goes for further Jedi training with Yoda but is later captured by Vader himself. Battles rage in space but also on the moon of Endor as the Rebels try to prevent the Empire taking over the Galaxy.This should have been the best of the series  the Jedi striking back after getting a kicking in part 5.  Indeed the battles and plotting suggests that it could have been.  Certainly the final confrontation between Luke and Vader could have been even better than the end of part 5  however it just doesn't feel as good as it could have been.The focus is very much on Luke and how he has changed since his discovery of this father.  Now he is dressed all in black and seems more ruthless than before.  This is explored reasonably well but it isn't as dark as it should have been  I never really believed that Luke could go to the Dark Side. The rest of the story is spoilt by one thing  Muppets.  This was supposed to be the big climax of the `three' films  we get that but we also have lots of puppets.  The Ewoks are OK as characters but the whole film has far too many puppets in it to be good.  Coming off the back of a much darker empire  Jedi is like walking out of a dark place into the light  it's just too bright and cheerful.  It should have had layers.Hamill is good as Luke but I wanted more depth  that said was good here but not as good as in Empire.  If you watch his three films together then you see him change which makes you appreciate him more.  Ford has little to do  it's like we've seen his space cowboy act before.  Fisher is the same but has more to do.  Ian McDiarmid is good  but again I appreciate his character even more now that I've seen parts one and two.  Yoda is cool but after Empire his screen time seems cut down (mind you part 2 made up for that).  Darth Vader is interesting  it's a bit sad but how many other characters have been played by three people (at the same time  not at different ages).  Vader's body is Prowse  his voice is Jones and his face is Shaw.Overall this is good  simply because it's a Star Wars movie and has plenty of action and thrills.  The muppets and brighter mood stop it being as good as the two before but at least now the Phantom Menace has shown us what a bad Star Wars film is like  now we know that Jedi isn't the weak link in the series.,positive

""Revenge of the Jedi"" was scrapped because it was deemed too harsh for mainstream movie audiences and didn't fit in with the noble character of the Jedi Knights. I couldn't quite understand that argument considering all the country had gone through after Watergate and Vietnam  and since movies and other forms of entertainment were getting more and more outrageous. Still  ""Return Of The Jedi"" works pretty well to convey the essence of the story  as Luke Skywalker stays true to his promise to avoid falling to the peril of the Dark Side of the Force.As I watched the film today  I wondered about the chronology and aging of the principal characters against the progress of the story  so I managed to dig up a Star Wars time line as published in one of the Dark Horse Comics from 2000. Even though ""The Empire Strikes Back"" occurs three years following ""A New Hope""  'Return' occurs only one year later. It appeared that Mark Hamill aged considerably more than his co-stars in the intervening years between the first and third movie  a period of six years. Maybe it's just me  but since it was noticeable  I thought I'd mention it.Though I found 'Return' as compelling and entertaining as the rest of the series  a couple of things did bother me back in the day  and those thoughts still linger. After the destruction of the original Death Star in the first film  I thought it was a little lazy to return to the same concept with an attack strategy that was fairly similar the first time around. The Ewok population on Endor may have distracted from that scenario  but the resolution was basically the same.The other thing  given the huge popularity he achieved after brief appearances in the films  it was somewhat disappointing to see how easily Boba Fett was taken out during the battle at the Sarlacc Pit  given his vaunted reputation as a fearsome galaxy bounty hunter. With the back story created for Boba Fett in ""Attack Of The Clones""  I wonder if Lucas would have offed him so unceremoniously if Episodes IV  V  and VI were made chronologically following I  II  and III. Something to think about  considering how much more was written about Boba Fett in comics and books after his death in 'Return'.Say  did anyone else notice that Lucas cleverly reversed the ""I love you""/""I know"" responses between Han and Leia as he prepares to join the battle on Endor? I only managed to catch that because I watched the films back to back over a couple of days. Not that I'm a huge Star Wars fan  but that's something that stood out.With the original trilogy completed in 1983  it would be a long wait until ""The Phantom Menace"" appeared to begin the story of Anakin Skywalker some sixteen years later. Yet it only seems like yesterday that all the episodes burst on the scene to create the greatest sci-fi adventure ever. The Force will be around for generations to come to thrill and entertain as they did from the very start.",positive

Disguised Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) does release Han  and Luke shows up  having to face a giant monster  but the eventually escape with the help of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams)  and Leia strangles Jabba to death. Luke quickly returns to the Degobah system to see master Yoda (voiced and performed by The Muppets' Frank Oz  aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) where he confirms Darth Vader is Luke's father  and he speaks of another Skywalker  before naturally dying. This other Ben (Obi-Won) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) says is Luke's sister  and he realises it's Leia. When they get back to the Rebels  they see the plan to destroy the shield generators of the new Death Star (from plans) by destroying the satellite on the planet Endor. Meanwhile  after a little rapid speed hover craft chase and meeting the cute and cuddly (for kids) Ewoks  Luke tells Leia of his revelation  before leaving to face Vader. He hands himself in to the Empire  and soon enough  Vader takes him to the psychopathic Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). As the battle between the Rebels and Empire goes on outside  and the Emperor convinces him of his friends being in danger  Luke eventually catches his light sabre to have a fight with Darth Vader  and release the Dark Side that the Emperor wants to see. Eventually  Han  Leia and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) knock out the satellite power  and Lando in the Millennium Falcon head for the centre of the Death Star. Luke ends the fight after cutting his father's hand off  and refuses to join the Dark Side  to which the Emperor starts electrocuting him with his Syth power. Darth Vader has a sudden change of heart though when he grabs the still electrocuting Emperor and tosses him off the edge. In his dying moments  he asks Luke to take his mask off so he can see him with his own eyes  and you see why he wheres the mask  and then he dies. Lando meanwhile reach the centre  blow it up  Luke gets away just in time  and the Death Star explodes.

Meanwhile on Tatooine Luke and the gang are attempting to rescue Han  who is still frozen in Carbonite  from Jabba the Hutt. Things don't appear to be going according to plan as most of them get captured and Jabba plans to execute most them by throwing them in to a pit inhabited by a strange beast. Leah however was put in a very skimpy costume and chained to Jabba which might be a fate worse than death. Not too surprisingly our heroes escape and head back to the rebel fleet.On the way Luke pays a visit to a very old friend on Dagobah to finish his training but he is told that he has finished but to become a Jedi he must face Darth Vader once more. He gets back to the fleet as they are planning their attack on the new Death Star. Before the main assault can take place they must disable the shield generator on the planet below  a mission will me lead by our heroes.On the planet they meet a strange race of creatures known as Ewoks who after a little misunderstanding is sorted out trust the group and help them confront the Imperial forces. Luke however realises that Vader is there and knows his presence is endangering the mission so he surrenders and is taken to Vader who flies with him to the Death Star where he meets the emperor and has his final battle against Darth Vader whilst the rebel fleet is attacking.As with all the original Star Wars films the isn't the cluttered CGI of the new films however some of the once great effects took dated as the blue screen scenes are fairly obvious  they are still exciting though  especially the chase though the forest on ""speeder-bikes"". The acting was good and it was nice to see Sir Alec Guinness return is a cameo as the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi.

The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut  furry woodland creatures  etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.None of the action ever focused too long in one spot  either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally  everyone was on the same page!

It's just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors.Han Solo  trapped in carbonite  has been delivered to the palace of Jabba the Hutt (by bounty hunter Boba Fett)  where he is displayed as a trophy by the huge slug-like space criminal. However  Han's rebel pals successfully carry out a daring rescue mission and  with the gang reunited  an attack is launched on the Empire's new improved Death Star  which is nearing completion.Luke's somewhat strained relationship with his old man is explored further  and it is also revealed that another member of the Skywalker family exists (providing the bad guys with an additional potential convert to the dark side of The Force).Return of the Jedi may not be perfectthe overly-cutesy Ewoks who aid the rebels are hated by many viewers  whilst the final attack scene is really nothing more than a rehash of Episode IV's assault on the original Death Starbut it is still a damn sight better than the abominations that are the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The visual effects are superbly executed  the action sequences genuinely exciting (in particular  the speeder bike chase gets the old neck hairs standing on end) and the whole movie looks great. If you can overlook the occasional silly 'comedy' moment and the odd lapse of logic (how did those Ewoks get those elaborate traps set up so quickly?)  you'll have a blast!Just make sure not to watch the 1997 Special Edition  which saw Lucas add several nasty GGI 'improvements'  including a terrible new musical number set in Jabba's palace  a poorly realised Sarlacc monster  some naff celebration scenes  and the iffy inclusion of Hayden Christensen as Anakin's 'ghost'.,positive

While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space  the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic  strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern  enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here  huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed  then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights  a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.After the fantastic 'Star Wars' and 'Empire Strikes Back' (now called parts IV and V on DVD)  the last episode 'Return of the Jedi' was bound to be somewhat of a let down  but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels' battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader  Luke Skywalker  and the Princess  and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke's Jedi training at the hands of Yoda  as Luke becomes the Last Samurai  I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month  and they are near perfect  as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high  and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars  Empire Strikes Back  and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV  V  and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are  and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.,positive

Apart from giving us the final showdown that we've been waiting for we are also treated to several other big chases and action sequences.Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher continue to impress and Mark Hamill does a good job of playing Luke's journey from young farm boy to Jedi knight convincingly.The only thing that slightly lets the film down is the Ewok subplot that continues to divide opinion to this day.Overall a nice end to the original trilogy.,positive

That's not to say there are not fans who prefer it of the original trilogy  because there are many  and like minded fans of George Lucas' space saga shouldn't have a problem with that.However  it is the weakest of the three. The characters we have come to love  and to be a part of their universe  are performed with gusto - but they are mostly thinly written  reduced to playing second fiddle to special effects  while the dark heart has been replaced with - well - smokey hokey (furry teddy bears with sticks and stones  I ask you). Then there's the lack of sexual tension so evident in the previous two films. Oh we love Han and Leia because that's love! But one can't help missing the sparks that was once between them - and Luke of course  hmm...Yet for all that  of the irks and complaints  Return of the Jedi is still a thrilling film  the budget up on the screen to entertain the children and the adults with the child within. Characters and creatures wander into this wonderful world for super impact. The Emperor  Jabba the scene stealer  Rancor and Sarlaac  while the speeder bike chase  further lightsaber shenanigans and the space battle ensure the action is never far away - even if one can be a little underwhelmed by the big finale not being all it can be.Ultimately it was not without faults  but still it was one hell of a conclusion to a genre defining (then) trilogy. 8/10,negative

Time has told us that THE PHANTOM MENACE and its two follow ups shows us that that there's a sucker born every minute who will watch any old rubbish if it ties in with STAR WARS . While watching RETURN OF THE JEDI I was struck as to how impressive it was in its own right never mind compared to the prequels spewed up by Lucas but also how superior it was to James Cameron's AVATAR a film that owes a lot to this one Story wise JEDI is no great shakes   being just a retread of the most part of the first film where The Imperial Empire are building a Death Star and the Rebel Alliance trying to stop them . Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with CameronRETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement,positive

It's an emotional journey  to be sure  more emotional than the first two films  but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller ""Eye of the Needle"")  the story is broken into a few major set pieces.Luke Skywalker  Princess Leia  Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt  the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah  where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage  and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly  seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable.While lacking the innovative nature of the first film  and dark  more mature quality of the second  this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga  in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been  and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert  swamp  forest  etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from ""Star Wars"". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks  those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them.Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader  as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course  I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia  which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years.""Return of the Jedi"" may not be as good as its predecessors overall  but it's still quite a bit of fun.Eight out of 10.",positive

The Emperor's attempted Killing of Luke and His Taunting to Embrace the Dark Side is Excruciatingly Drawn Out.The Fluctuating Feelings and Changing Tapestry throughout the Movie render a somewhat Clunky Tonality to the Overall Effort.There are still Plenty of Things to Admire in the Production.

These are only a Few of the Reasons that ""Jedi"" doesn't quite measure up to the Previous Pictures.The Movie did make more Money  because of the Growing Fan Base  and the Anticipatory Aspect of the Intervening Three Year Wait.

Luke Skywalker.Why this movie doesn't have a higher rating  I don't know. Maybe it's because of the ewoks (that's why my mother doesn't like it as much). I say: those ewoks had very little to do with the creative genius of this movie.It was a masterpiece. It all came together perfectly and seamlessly. It even started off terrificly with Luke Skywalker showing off his full fledged Jedi skills. There is action  humor  action  honor  and more action... and the special effects... whew  light years ahead of its time. We were treated with two epic battles: the inter-galactic battle between the federation and the rebel forces  and the smaller but equally important battle between Luke and the Emperor  Luke and his father  and Luke and the Dark Side. Luke was in a perilous struggle internally with his feelings. You could see as he was slowly being poisoned with anger  concern  and perhaps a bit of fear. The Emperor had a very grand plan in mind for Luke and the rebel forces. That plan was all coming to fruition except for the will power and intelligence of Luke and Han Solo. As a child ""Return of the Jedi"" was my absolute favorite bar none. Well  Since childhood ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has toppled it. I'm a little older now and being more knowledgeable  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a bit more intellectually appealing. Even still  ""Return of the Jedi"" ranks extremely high with me and always will.",positive

Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office  I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight  I am glad I saw it  but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already  mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead  let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also  I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally  while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film  it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog  but the end was all special effects. Still  I must admit that they were very  very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character ""Pepper Potts"" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular  Graham Chapman  coined the term ""Pepperpot"" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged ""ladies"".UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance  the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film.",positive

It looks fabulous  the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it)  awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences  which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload  all of which is laugh-out-loud funny  yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war  which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing  he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best  doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good  loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally  the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been  other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

First he's quite the vulnerable one and second he's put together with extreme  but very human intelligence. Nobody came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond mortal men. No one got their DNA mixed up with some animal to give them some extra-sapien traits. No Iron Man is put together in a laboratory after a prototype is done while in captivity in a cave.That's probably both the strength and weakness of this film. Robert Downey  Jr.  Gwyneth Paltrow and most of all Jeff Bridges look like they're having a great old time putting flesh and bone on comic strip characters. I'm glad they enjoyed it  I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do these kind of films.Iron Man is updated to today's world situation  but with some Thirties flashbacks because it's an arms dealer who is the chief villain here. Downey is like Bruce Wayne  a multimillionaire heir to an armaments fortune who likes to have a good time as well as work while Bridges minds the company day to day. But that MIT education did not go for naught as those Afghan terrorists found out. Downey proves as resourceful as B.A. Baracus of the A-Team in developing the Iron Man first to escape captors and then to defeat bad guys. And these bad guys are quite in league.But while the special effects are nice and the players are having a good time  Iron Man reminded me of a Popeye cartoon. Downey and Bridges looked Popeye and Bluto in the best two out of three falls. All that Downey needed to do was reach for that can of Spinach.I half expected he would.,positive

My money's on the latter  but a lot of people seem to rave over this comic book adaptation that sees a Howard Hughes-style inventor making himself a metal suit and using it to fight various nefarious characters. In recent years I've seen the superhero genre on the wane  with boring and predictable outings lacking the spark that earlier hits enjoyed (such as SPIDER-MAN and DAREDEVIL  although I know I'm in the minority in liking the latter). IRON MAN to me was routine  overlong and frequently dull  telling the 'samey' kind of origin story we've been seeing since whenever  and definitely lacking in entertainment value.It didn't help that Tony Stark's character grated on me from the beginning. We're supposed to believe this arrogant weapons manufacturer has a change of heart and wants to do good for the world  all the while retaining his quirky charm. Puh-lease! In actual fact  I was on the side of the (unrecogniseable) Jeff Bridges  cast here as the mentor-turned-villain. Bridges was the only one in the film who seemed to have the right idea what to do with Stark  i.e. beat seven shades of hell out of him.The plot plods along  taking trips to the Middle East along the way for some bloodless hijinks that see Stark building himself a suit of iron out of a few left-overs. BLUE PETER for guys  if you will. It also returns to the area later on for a rather entertaining fight sequence  but action and pretty special effects alone can't win the day for Stark. After the umpteenth confrontation  we're left with the sight of two metal men beating the tar out of each other in a climax lifted from ROBOCOP 2  and the ending drags on forever. Sadly  Stark ends up saving the day  which means that a sequel was greenlit.Other things working against the film: Gwyneth Paltrow's robot-like performance as ""Pepper Potts""  with whom Stark's character shares mucho dull flirtation. What did Hollywood ever see in this actress? Terrence Howard's military man is as dull as dishwater  and the only minor moments of fun come from watching our hero make implausible use of his engineering skills. But then  if I wanted to see that  I'd rather plump for SCRAPHEAP CHALLENGE  I think.",positive

I never was a comic book movie guy but my opinion on them has changed over the past couple years since directors and screenwriters decided to throw some brains into the film. Here's another fine example of a film that has something to say and doesn't just resort to non-stop action and slapstick violence. The movie is extremely well made  wonderfully acted and contains some great special effects and that makes it one of the better films of its type. I think the key to this film working is the performance by Downey  Jr. who makes you feel as if everything you're watching could really happen. I think a lot of times you really have to suspend your disbelief but that's not the case here because Downey is so great that you feel he really knows how to create this suit and make it work. I loved the early scenes before the terrorist attack when Downey uses his comic skills because this shows what a changed man he is after he is able to escape. The supporting cast is also very good with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges doing fine work  although I felt both of their characters could have been written better. Gwyneth Paltrow is the one who really shocked me because I had seen many of her artsy films and was shocked at how well she could handle this material. The chemistry between her and Downey is great and adds a lot of suspense to the film especially in the final minutes. Favreau does a wonderful job with his directing duties and manages to keep the story movie and to keep the viewer entertained even though the final Iron Man doesn't show up until a hour into the film. I'm not a fan of CGI because I feel most directors don't know how to use it but that's not the case here because the effects fit in well with the story and they never try to be the main focus of the film.,positive

How Ironic!,2009-11-06,I got a kick out of this film. I have never seen one of the comic books nor do I know about the exploits of this figure. It is a nicely done superhero film which traces the origins of the character. Robert Downey is quite good  balancing his innate arrogance against his good intentions. Jeff Bridges is also an excellent adversary. One of the most impressive scenes in the move is the opening in the deserts of Afghanistan as a roadside bomb explodes and Downey and a group of soldiers come under fire. It really gives one a sense of what those people face each day. It may even be a bit real for a fantasy romp like this is. It is down and dirty. There are great events  including the building of the first suit and his effort to exact revenge against the forces that have used his weapons systems to persecute and destroy the civilian population. There is a lot of action and it's not superfluous. Downey's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow and the robots in his lab are a lot of fun. For pure escapism  it's really fun.

And he should not only lead the ""Iron Man"" franchise  but quickly afterward also become the new ""Sherlock Holmes"" and certainly a superior one to Benedict Cumberbatch. But lets get back to this film we have here. It received great audience numbers and critics reviews and was one of the main reasons why superhero films are so much en vogue again. But it's not all Downey Jr.'s achievement. Jeff Bridges created a nice main antagonist shortly before his Oscar win and then there is of course Jon Favreau's (an actor himself  also appears in here) strong direction and a truly excellent script for such a genre film.Its biggest strength is probably how well-structured it all is. The first third is about the hostage situation  the second is about Stark's change in character and the consequences and the final third of the film is what you may call the boss fight. I generally don't mind if we find out about the main antagonist right away  but it was also nicely done with the path they chose here. Then again  Marvel fans certainly knew right away. It was a very smart decision. The terrorists were the main villains for at least half the film until we found out who was in charge of them really and there is one scene way into the second half during which we see they are not in control at all. It's also a decent development that will not offend people that follow the religion of Islam  who may have seen this film as being too much against their faith otherwise.The film runs for slightly over 2 hours with credits and that's perfectly fine. No need to stretch it to 150 minutes and the way it is it also never drags and is an enjoyable watch from start to finish. The only somewhat negative association I had came with Gwyneth Paltrow who was occasionally cringeworthy in her few scenes. Then again  I do not see much talent in her anyway. And one notion about the Transformers-like fight at the end. I would have preferred that the way he could have won would have been with that reference to freezing armor  which was very nice and certainly would have been my preferred choice over a collaboration battle with Paltrow's character. It also would have emphasized again what they were telling us for the entire film. Stark may have been a bon vivant  but he is also a lone wolf. Apart from that  I was happy that the film focused a lot more on story than on special effects and visuals. I wish more superhero films would go that route.As a whole  needless to say now that I enjoyed the watch and will certainly rewatch the second film and watch the third at some point. And I am not even speaking about the other Avengers film that I will certainly watch at some point in the future too. Thanks to Mr. Samuel L. Jackson for leading us towards them in the post-credit sequence. As for ""Iron Man""  this was a pretty good effort I must say. Delivered in basically all areas convincingly and I urge you to check this one out. On a final note  I liked that they cast fairly unknown actors for major supporting parts here such as Yinsen and Raza  also something that other (superhero) film makers should go for in the future.",positive

This pleased his father  who was equally as skilled and had built his internationally successful weapons company up from the ground with the sole aim of arming his country to help them win the wars they face. When his father died when he was still young  the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but  at 21  Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and  it must be said  something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out  but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture  an announcement that dismays Stane and the board  but not as much as his other plans would.Iron Man was more or less the first big film of the summer and  unlike the blockbuster season of 2007 it was a good start because Iron Man pretty much did everything that a Blockbuster should. It is big noisy fun  with good action sequences  comedy and effects and it is yet another superhero movie  which is the only thing about it that gave me cause for concern. The thing is  as good as some of them are  we also have lame ones where the focus is on the effects and nothing else. Iron Man is not the new Batman films but nor is it anywhere near the level of Fantastic Four  if anything it is like what one would want Fantastic Four to be like. I say this meaning that Iron Man has a solid plot (although the ""developmental"" film is generally the ""easiest"" one to get right)  fun characters and a good sense of humour thanks to the character of Stark  I mean  I like Batman's tortured psyche as a subject but Stark would be a lot more fun to hang out with.Towards the end  the plot suddenly moves past the developmental plot line and gets to the ""conclusion"". It is noisy and not as exciting as I would have liked but it is good enough to satisfy those who want to see their money up on the screen. For me the rest of the film was stronger as it focused on Stark  who is nailed by a perfectly cast Downey Jr. His acerbic sense of humour and real lifestyle of excess helps the film and he is an enjoyable centre piece who remains a presence even when he is just a CGI effect on screen. Paltrow looks good and fills the undemanding role well despite me personally not liking her that much. Bridges was a solid presence for the most part  even if not that much is made of him  while Howard is a good name to allow the series to continue with stars on board. I didn't think that Favreau would be up to the task since this is really his first big budget action film but  while not anything special  he did a good job and perhaps it helped with the humour to have him on board but we shall see if he returns with Iron Man 2 (which I'm assuming is a given as a project).So OK we have the Batmans and other good films this summer but for simple popcorn enjoyment  Iron Man holds its own. Don't look for a lot of soul searching (Stark's change of heart is more a plot device than a subject for exploration) but if you would solid action  some good laughs and a generally enjoyable product then this will fill that need till the next one comes along.",negative

Now I was never a Marvel Comics geek  my favorite characters were the mainstays of the DC Comics universe  like Superman  Batman  Green Lantern  et al. But if you were a fan  you couldn't help but know about the alternative universe that contained Spider-Man  The Incredible Hulk  The X-Men and Iron Man  which brings us to the subject at hand. I thought that the movie did a credible job of spanning the forty year comic book history of Iron Man about as well as could be expected in a distilled down two hour movie. Particularly effective was the way we see how the origin costume in the picture pays tribute to the early Iron Man years  while the modern day red and gold armor conveys the advance of science and technology into the twenty first century. Comic book purists will most likely have serious issues with the picture  but I've been able to get over the whole faithfulness to continuity issue some time ago. What I'm looking for in a flick like ""Iron Man"" is an opportunity to be entertained for a couple of hours  and there's enough here to have some fun and be just that - entertained.The one thing I AM looking for in the Marvel universe pictures is the ubiquitous cameo appearance of Stan Lee  creator of many of the comic book icons we recognize today. He's incorrectly credited in the cast listing as I write this  as he's listed appearing as himself. What you need to do is pay attention to that party scene in the casino when Tony Stark says hi to 'Hef'. That was just the coolest way to get Stan into the picture  and I give him a lot of credit for not taking himself too seriously as he truly is one of the gods of comic book history.As for the picture  it's easy enough to bash it for it's adherence to current world events and the milieu of extremist terrorism. But is that any worse than reliving the events of the early 1960's and placing the character in the middle of the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? The present day Iron Man can be a product of his time and still be effective as a symbol of patriotism and honor  even while the rest of the country is immersed in presidential primaries and partisan politics.You have to give credit to the selection of Robert Downey Jr. for the Iron Man role. Perhaps his own bouts with substance abuse uniquely prepared him for an outstanding performance as the conflicted title character. However the character I was intrigued with the most was Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane  I just couldn't get over his appearance as Tony Stark's operations chief. The role was played with just the right amount of reserve and just below the surface malice; I thought he did an excellent job. Gwyneth Paltrow had pretty much a thankless job as Stark's personal assistant and secret admirer and it didn't seem to me that her performance was all that stand out.As an aside  the one thing I feel I do have to comment on is a personal gripe of mine relative to the IMDb ranking system. As I write this  ""Iron Man"" sits at number #130 of the all time best films as ranked by current users. It seems to me that the way fans line up behind a picture even before it's released  there ought to be a moratorium of say  two or three years before a new release could be eligible for Top 250 ranking. When you consider the truly great films of all time like ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane""  it's hard for me to reconcile a popcorn flick like this one to be considered in the same breath. I feel the same way (as to a voting moratorium) about stunning pictures like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"". If a picture has the legs to stand up as an all time great  it will be remembered a couple years after it's original release. Remember all the fanboy hype about ""Serenity""? Does anyone even care about that picture today? See what I mean?",positive

As a comic reader for twenty years  I knew him and have come across him from time to time  but never really found his story that intriguing. He is  basically  Marvel's answer to Batman. That being said  this movie was excellent.I think they fit in all the necessary story parts  and they were executed wonderfully. Robert Downey Jr has finally made the comeback he deserves  and is bigger than ever. I am unclear about the Pepper Potts situation  but think it is being handled well in this film -- she is obviously conflicted  both in love with her boss but also wary of his womanizing. That makes sense. And the way they made his transformation from jerk to somewhat respected is a nice move.Purists might be upset that his origins were moved from Vietnam to Afghanistan  but that would just be protesting nonsense. In order for Stark to fit the timeline of the Avengers story (in the films)  he needs to be modern  and I think this was handled excellently.,positive

Basically Tony Stark (National Movie Award nominated Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful and rich head of Stark Industries  who manufacture weapons all over the world  and his life is changed when he is badly wounded in the chest. Tony is saved by a special metal based plate in his chest that keeps the shrapnel from reaching his heart  but he is also forced to create a new weapon by his Middle Eastern captors. In the time he has to build this weapon  he instead creates a metal armoured suit to make his escape and attack all in his way  and he manages it. When Tony returns to the US  he announces that from his experiences  he realises his company is not doing good making weapons  and he starts making modifications to his armour suit design. While Tony changes the design  manufacturing it with gold and titanium  and adding a jet-propulsion system to fly  his second in charge Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is still selling weapons to the Middle East. While in Afganistan  Stane comes face to face with Tony's original metal suit  and decides that it the new unknown ""Iron Man"" in the city  to go up against him. In the end  after defeating Stane  and against the advice of his crush-driven personal secretary Virginia 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow)  Tony announces to America and the world that he is Iron Man. Also starring Terrence Howard as Rhodey  Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart  Shaun Toub as Yinsen  Faran Tahir as Raza  Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson  Bill Smitrovich as General Gabriel  Paul Bettany as Jarvis and look out for Stan Lee as the man in the smoking jacket. Downey Jr. has been away as a leading star for a while  and this is a fantastic return for him  and he has great support from a reliable Paltrow  and a mean performance from Bridges. There is good action and adventure  there are great special effects coupled with cool gadgets  and a quite engaging story to carry you along  it is a great fantasy superhero movie.

At least he was until he is captured by insurgents in Afghanistan and learns that it isn't only the good guys who use his products. Once they have him the insurgents instruct him to make them a version of his latest weapon; instead he makes an armoured suit that renders him bullet proof and even enables him to fly. Using the suit he manages to escape and when he gets back to the United States he renounces the arms trade much to the consternation of this erstwhile partner. Tony now devotes his time to making a new improved version of the suit which he uses to protect the people that where being oppressed by his company's weapons. He isn't the only person with an armoured suit though; his partner Obadiah Stane is building one too and when it is completed he will attempt to destroy Tony.I found the earlier parts of this film to be the best; Robert Downey Jr. did a good job as Tony Stark making his damascene conversion from arms dealer to protector of the innocent believable at the end the story was just about two giant robots I mean men in power suits fighting; although I'm sure that is the scene younger members of the audience will enjoy most. Jeff Bridges also put in a good performance as bad guy Obadiah and Gwyneth Paltrow was fine as Tony's PA Pepper Potts. I was rather pleased that they managed to avoid the cliché of Tony and Pepper becoming a couple even if it was hinted that they might become one in the future. Unlike a lot of super heroes Tony Stark has no problem with killing his enemies and the weapons he uses may mean some parents might not thing this film is suitable for younger children.,positive

Neither the action segments nor the lulls  the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but  frankly  what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a ""kids"" movie made today. Thankfully  that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent ""Transformers"" film I viewed.The scenes with ""Iron Man"" a.k.a. ""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance  catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot  piloted by the corporate bad guy ""Obadiah Stane"" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see  too.Some complain the film is not really all that ""smart"" and it's a bit too predictable  but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters. Speaking of characters  it wasn't easy to recognize Bridges with a bald head and full beard but once I heard his distinctive voice  I knew who it was. Gywneth Paltrow played a sweet role as Stark's loyal secretary  ""Pepper Potts."" (Nice name!!). The Afghanistan villain was credible. Actually  I liked him better than the obnoxious Liberal news reporter  who was annoying.The ""moral"" of the story the screenwriters preach is that military might as a deterrent to fighting terrorists can easily backfire as companies which manufacture arms for the U.S. could also be acquired by bad guys (because of greedy and corrupt U.S. businessmen). This is naive Liberal propaganda  the kind I would expect out of the movie industry  whether in Hollywood or Europe. Sadly  there will never be a shortage of bullies and evil people  who will then crush an unarmed foe as the people in this film attempt to do. It's also implausible any company like the one shown in this movie could so easily travel to a hot spot like Afghanistan and deal with terrorists. It's unrealistic  but that's today's movies for you. Also  despite the nonviolent message in the story  the good guy sure wipes out his share of people with a variety of weapons! For someone preaching peace  he sure didn't hesitate in killing opponents.Iron Man's metal suit is definitely very cool  equipped with about anything you'd need to fight an army of terrorists  or anyone else. The suit - and his super pacemaker - turn him into a Superman-type guy in that he can fly pretty high and pretty high. The latter part - how high he could fly - makes a nice conclusion  by the way  regarding the good guy's battle against the ""bad Iron Man.""",positive

Tony continues what his father had built  and takes it a few steps further with his own inventions.Another actor I always like is Terrence Howard  and here he is long time friend of Tony's  and a military officer  Rhodey.Tony's right hand man in his company is Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. He had run the company while Tony was still growing up and seems to want to continue his expanded role.Good as Tony's trusty personal assistant is Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.

But there is a motorcade attack and Tony gets imprisoned  with the demand that he develop the new weapon for them. Instead he invents something new  a rather crude iron man suit that he eventually uses to break free. But the experience changes him  as he sees that even the enemy have weapons that his company makes. His big decision when back home is to quit making weapons and instead concentrate on helping humanity.SPOILERS: When back home Tony works hard to perfect a sleek new Iron Man suit  one that can fly anywhere and even at supersonic speeds  and that has exotic weapon and navigational capabilities. In the process he has Pepper track down through company records how enemies were getting weapons.

But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark's as a character not exactly the usual 'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada' thing. He has a more jaded attitude  slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait  sorry  iron  or alloy as it is). I'm almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters  only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money  lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire  and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don't identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And  when the time comes  he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time  when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man  he does have a level of conscience from the start  realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there  though it's pretty much that)  and wants to not want this any longer. Instead  basically  he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan  he'll come and wipe em out in a jiffy. In this sense it's pure escapism  but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True  it might be much to imagine  but in the realm of a comic book movie  where we're already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he's that damn good.It's a thrill-ride  and it's very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in  for example  Ghost Rider. It's genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane  yeah you read that right)  or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake  this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast. You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man  but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can't do it with a George Clooney  but with Downey Jr. it's a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He's able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero  but also hint at the fact that he's playing this character for what he is  and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him  it wouldn't work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it's due  also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is  basically  the ""anti-dude"" as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark's technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow  where'd she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well  and a couple of other supporting parts  they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director  who should get credit where it's certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer  going up through Made  Elf  and the recent bomb Zathura  it's a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go  he doesn't tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick  efficient film-making  and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched 'test' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here  Favreau's is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line  and how its delivered and in the context  is worth the price of admission.Oh  and by the way  stay through the end credits. If you're geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches)  you'll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.",positive

What a nicely romantic team they play here!

He's a regular on ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"". There's great drama in Afganistan and plenty of kick-butt action in whatever city this movie takes place in that I was wholly enthralled the whole way through.

The plot is not very engaging either  it is not exciting enough. The characters are poorly developed too. I do not find myself care for any of the characters  except maybe Stark. Poor Gwyneth Paltrow  she is such a supporting character in here  and her role could be played by anyone. Action scenes are sparse and short  and not exciting at all.

Having now seen it finally  seeing as audience reaction seemed more divisive (especially here where the dislike is unnecessarily vitriolic) which did put me off watching it for a while  it was a good film if not a great one. It was very entertaining  and credit is due for trying to take more of a comedic edge to a genre that can be taken seriously (sometimes overly so) and for taking risks. At the same  'Deadpool' is also uneven. 'Deadpool' for me did have its issues. Tonally  it is not always balanced  with too much emphasis on the humour and not enough on the action. Contrary to what others thought  most of the humour was enjoyable but there were jokes and lines that didn't land very well due to taking it too far with the crudeness and childishness (some of the superhero cliché jokes felt very out of date and stale). Other minuses are the overlong length  some repetition  a pretty forgettable villain and a rushed and muddled final act. However  'Deadpool' is very well made visually. Slick  stylish and brooding with typically well crafted effects. The music is haunting and rousing and most of the direction is very assured and sharp  if at times not always in control of the tonal balances. The action is dynamically choreographed and exciting  and the romantic and emotional elements just about avoid the mawkish sentimentality trap and instead give 'Deadpool' its heart.Most of the humour is very funny  though its extremely black comedic nature has proven to be an acquired taste. As said  that it tried to incorporate humour into an often taken seriously genre was interesting and refreshing  even if there is a try too hard element at times with how it's balanced with everything else. The story is a pretty lightweight one structurally  but the hugely energetic pace and sense of fun elevated it. Ryan Reynolds brings charismatic charisma  vulnerability and great comic timing to the title role  one he was born to play and he successfully allows one to root for his character. All the cast do a more than serviceable job  Morena Baccarin coming over the most confidently. In summary  good film if not great. Rough around the edges but not without its charm  like the titular character hero himself. 7/10 Bethany Cox,positive

On the one hand  I generally enjoy modern-day superhero movies  which are very much all of a kind but have decent special effects and lots of action to see them through. They're easy viewing. On the other hand  I'm no fan of crude humour and bad language  and I knew what to expect with this one. I don't think much of Ryan Reynolds  either. I was pleased to find  then  that I enjoyed DEADPOOL quite a bit. It's not one of my favourite superhero films but as an origin story it does the job nicely and there are lots of memorable quirky moments and characters to enjoy. As a comedy  it's also a lot wittier than I was expected  and I enjoyed picking up all of the pop culture references. The crudeness did nothing for me but most of it was in the form of throaway lines so didn't matter too much. The strong supporting cast features an on-form Ed Skrein and a typically hulking Gina Carano  but Colossus was my favourite 'star' here. The CGI-augmented action scenes are well staged and the action has a nicely brutal edge. To me  this feels like a natural successor to the CRANK films  albeit better made.,positive

The ""doctor"" named Francis (Ed Skrein) instead does a horrible experiment on him and soon the deformed man takes the name Deadpool and goes out for revenge.I'm not a comic book person and I know very little about them outside of what I see in movies. With that said  it seems DEADPOOL got a pretty big group of people who gathered around to say that a R-rated comic book movie would never work and that the studio was committing suicide. Well  the box office numbers certainly proved them wrong as the film managed to take in a lot of money as well as please critics and fans. Personally speaking while most comic book movies are good  they are start to look and sound alike so getting something as fresh as DEADPOOL was terrific.I think the best thing that can be said about the film is that it just stands out among the various other comic movies out there. Naturally the R-rating is the selling point because this ""hero"" loves to cuss  have sex  tell dirty jokes and when he kills someone he wants their brains splattered everywhere. All of this madness is what makes the film seem so fresh because the action scenes are pure 100% action with non-stop bloody violence that is just fun to watch. The comic tone is hilarious at times due to the character's sarcastic nature and dirty mouth. Everything here works extremely well and this includes the real mutants and their super powers. Everything in the film is a joke and what's most shocking is that it's all funny.The casting was certainly the most important thing and Reynolds handles the role with ease. I think it's safe to say after watching the film that they selected the perfect man for the part and can you really think of anyone who would have done it better? Reynold's comic timing is flawless and he really makes Deadpool one of the most memorable characters out there. Skrein is very good in the role as the villain and Morena Baccarin is also very good playing the love interest. Even more great humor comes from T.J. Miller in his role as the comic relief.DEADPOOL certainly earns its R-rating and delivers the goods in terms of dirty laughs and graphic violence. I'm not sure how many other comic book movies are going to be willing to do this but this certainly stands out from the crowd and best of all is that the dirty humor isn't just a gimmick because it actually works very well.",positive

This is a non-stop  fast-paced  4th wall breaking  no holds barred style of comedy. I guess a minority could object to its crudeness. There is a monotone to this style. That's why the funniest moment is the cabby's second ride. It comes out of nowhere. The shock and awe of it is hilarious. I like Negasonic and Colossus. Gina Carano again proves that she's no actor.

Like the film itself  it was all done with such irreverence and lack of respect for the genre  that I found it quite refreshing – particularly as superhero films continue to puff themselves into bigger and more serious epic franchises. Mostly  the film itself manages to deliver in the same vein  but it is not as consistent as I would have wanted – and I can understand those that hate it.For all its subversive humor  the plot of the film is a collection of familiar tropes – the kidnap  the revenge  the origin story etc. An added downside is that this flaw doesn't really matter  because the plot always feels like it is an afterthought that the writers added once they had all the jokes and scenes they wanted down on paper. These are pretty funny  and the irreverent tone helps it work  but if you are not in the right frame of mind then it will probably grate quite a lot. The action set-pieces are pretty enjoyable though  and it does play well as a faux-subversive entry in the genre.It is fun  rude  and gory; and it is enjoyable for it. It does have its weaknesses though  and in the end it is not as clever or different as it thinks it is.,negative

The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult  more adult than ""Kick-Ass "" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids  but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films  but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words  brief sex and nudity.

And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it  is not everybody's taste of course  but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles)  than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this  leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played  not as successful  if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer  there are so many jokes in here  you will find many things to like.

I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did  but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb  and many of them glowing tributes  I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there  as well as DC  but with this venture  the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters  I'm not a prude  but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison  I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton""  and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside  this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted  I've never read a Deadpool comic  so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page  but if it is  it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes  well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete  I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots  but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out  otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer  there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second  I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally  there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie  to me it resembled a dead pool.",positive

Basically in New York City  former special forces operative Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) works as a mercenary  he meets and becomes romantically attached to escort Vanessa Carlysle (Gotham's Morena Baccarin). A year later Wade proposes to Vanessa and she accepts  but he suddenly collapses  at hospital he is diagnosed with terminal cancer  Vanessa remains by his side  but he fears losing her. Wade is approached by a Recruiter (Jed Rees) from a secret program  he offers him an experimental cure for his cancer  Wade initially refuses  but he later leaves Vanessa and undergoes the procedure. At a laboratory Wade meets and instantly resents Ajax (Ed Skrein) and Angel Dust (Gina Carano)  Wade is injected with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes  then he is subjected to weeks of torture to trigger mutation  with no success. Ajax  who Wade finds out his real name is Francis Freeman  reveals the true purpose of the experiments is to create super-powered slaves for wealthy customers  Wade does develop healing abilities  but his face and skin are severely disfigured  he escapes his chamber  but is impaled by Ajax and left inside the laboratory that is burning down. Wade survives and returns to the city  he wants to reconnect with Vanessa  but he is unable to come to terms with his appearance and stays away  with some help from his best friend Weasel (T.J. Miller) he decides to hunt down Ajax  who claimed he could cure his disfigurement. Wade becomes a masked vigilante  using the nickname ""Deadpool""  and he moves in with elderly blind woman Al (Leslie Uggams)  Deadpool follows a number of leads from various syndicates to find Ajax  he eventually locates her  causing chaos on the expressway. Cornering Ajax  Wade demands a cure for his disfigurement  but he is interrupted by two X-Men  Piotr Rasputin aka Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Ellie Phimister aka Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand)  they have been trying to recruit Deadpool  Ajax escapes  Deadpool is handcuffed to Colossus  but he cuts his own arm off to escape  his arm regenerates overnight. Now knowing that Wade is alive  Ajax goes to Weasel's bar and finds out about Vanessa  Weasel tells Wade that she is in danger  but he is still unable to face her  and she is already kidnapped  Wade is told by Ajax and Angel Dust to meet with them on a decommissioned helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to join him to confront Ajax and Angel Dust  Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel Dust  while Deadpool battle many henchmen  and eventually engages Ajax in close combat. After the big battle  the equipment holding the helicarrier upright is accidentally destroyed  Colossus  who was knocked out  wakes and takes Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety  Deadpool successfully saves Vanessa  and Ajax is subdued  he reveals there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement. Colossus urges Deadpool to be a true hero and spare Ajax  but Deadpool kills Ajax  he turns to Vanessa and removes his mask to reveal his disfigured face  she is angered that he left her  but she still loves and accepts him  they reconcile and kiss. Also starring Karan Soni as Dopinder  Michael Benyaer as Warlord and Stan Lee as Strip Club DJ. Reynolds is a good choice as the wisecracking anti- hero who calls himself a bad guy going against the ""worse guys""  his breaking of the fourth wall  sending up the clichés and in-jokes about him knowing he is in a superhero movie works well  he even jokes about his unfortunate performance as the Green Lantern. This X-Men spin- off is good fun  it makes you laugh in the right places  the romantic element is alright  you really root for the vulnerable and naughty masked mutant  the explosive chase and fight sequences  and some comical violence  combined with the special effects are great  overall it is a most worthwhile fantasy action comedy.

After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see  through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman  AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes  some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.,positive

Wow  ""Deadpool"" is a fantastic combination of action  comedy  satire and spoofs. The story in the movie is fairly straight forward  actually bordering on being generic. But it was the sly remarks  the physical comedy of the Wade/Deadpool character that really made the movie work out so nicely. And Ryan Reynolds  despite already having played other superhero roles  really was nicely cast for the Deadpool character.The audience is thrown into the fray right from the very beginning  and the movie kicks up into an impressive gear and high speed from the very start  and it never slows down.The cast in ""Deadpool"" were doing some good jobs with their given roles and characters. And I must admit that I was more than genuinely impressed with what Ryan Reynolds (playing Wade / Deadpool) managed to deliver with his part in this movie. But also Morena Baccarin (playing Vanessa) really brought something good to the movie with her skills and on-screen charisma. And T.J. Miller really had a great part in the movie  despite it not being a prominent character.There is a lot of action throughout the course of ""Deadpool""  which was really well choreographed and equally well executed.I will say that ""Deadpool"" is without a doubt the best superhero movie that I have ever seen.

But no hero.,2016-05-05,Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) falls in love with escort girl Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin)  but soon-after discovers that he has late-stage cancer. When a strange man approaches Wade saying that he can not only cure his disease  but also give him incredible powers  he is sceptical  but eventually undergoes the treatment—a long and agonising process that scars his entire body—unaware that the people conducting the operation intend to use him as a 'weapon for hire'.From the ironic opening credits to the inevitable post-credits sequence  Deadpool is an absolute blast  a side-splittingly funny  hyper-kinetic and incredibly bloodthirsty superhero movie for those fed up with normal superhero movies. This one takes everything expected from the genre and subverts it  creating a deliciously dark adventure in which the lead character  imbued with invincibility  doesn't want to be a hero he simply wants revenge. As Deadpool sets about finding Francis  the man who caused him so much pain and melted his good looks  he takes special delight in countless outrageous acts of extreme violence  pausing to break the fourth wall with witty remarks aimed at the viewer. This 'self-awareness' only adds to the fun.While not 'the best superhero movie ever' as some people claim (that honour still goes to Days of Future Past)  it's a very close second.

I am not familiar with the source comic book. The movie is rated R for a good reason  the main character has a very filthy potty mouth  but it fits his character. Plus a few shots of bare-chested women.This is an origin story. Ryan Reynolds is Wade  always a bit of a loose canon. At his favorite bar is a list on a chalkboard  a ""dead pool""  predicting who will be the next to get killed. Wade is with his girlfriend when he collapses  at the clinic his doctor informs him he has cancer  but in three places he doesn't need - his brain  his lungs  and his prostate.He meets a man who says he can ""fix"" him  Wade has no choice and submits. He ends up being tortured in various ways  it is an attempt to make the hidden beast in him come out. When he finally escapes he is disfigured but has gained some pretty impressive strength and fighting skills  plus his cancer is gone. He can't go openly as Wade anymore  so takes the name 'Deadpool.'His nemesis is Ed Skrein as Ajax  and his girlfriend is Morena Baccarin as Vanessa. Can he defeat Ajax and get his girl back?The action is impressive  including the opening ultra slo-mo shot of Deadpool and others in a roll-over car accident on a bridge.

It wasn't the wisest comparison (maybe filthy f***ing Bugs Bunny is far more accurate  but I digress)  in large part since the Muppets are family entertainment with an edge that can appeal to adults and yet still be good fun for kids  while Deadpool is hard-R action carnage with sometimes (ok  a good lot of the time) lines that will make many  many  many teenagers laugh (and some folks who get a few key references to things outside of this decade). I think I was just responding to the total irreverence of the whole thing  not to mention the constant breaking of the fourth wall - it's not something completely groundbreaking on its own (Spider-Man talks to the audience  for example)  but here it's aware of many of the faults that have come up on comic book and super-hero movies  including its own franchise. For me one of the most cathartic moments of this or any recent movie is seeing a short but noticeable image of an action figure of Deadpool from the 2009 Wolverine movie. Which sucked.Why it did is for reasons outside of the 'not getting the character' right thing (though that's part of it)  but suffice it to say what director Tim Miller (first timer! impressive that) and the writers (previously of the also super-self-conscious/meta Zombieland)  needed to do was to take the p*** out of the genre while also delivering a story that had some heart to it... wait  heart  in a movie that has the ""Merc with the Mouth"" Wade Wilson   the guy who goes through Weapon-X-program-stuff and comes out with the skin of insert-TJ-Miller-Joke-Here appearance? Sure  why not? If I can take it back to the Muppets one last time those movies had heart to them underneath as well. With this Deadpool movie  there's only a couple of scenes where there's no sarcastic lines or quips or just outright 'I'll talk s*** till the cows come home' stuff  but they do help to give the movie some grounding and keep things moving along well.When I say it's hard-R  I mean it - if you take your kids  make sure they know what they're in for and that despite the appearance of the Xavier School  this is very violent and bloody and with limbs flying and heads rolling and little tiny hands regenerating and... too much said. But for me  at least in the first half of the movie before it got to the climax (which I'll get to in a moment)  it was refreshing to see how violent it got. I'm not completely sure if it was Miller and the filmmaers' intentions but I suspected all of bodies laid to waste in sometimes horrifying ways is some kind of comment on how bloodless many of the comic book movies and other X-Men films can get. Sure people die and get stabbed by Wolverine and so on  but there's no consequences. Deadpool is the kind of movie where Colossus (that one big Russian metal guy who was in the other X-Men movie that I don't remember the name of) tries to tell Wade not to hurt any people on a highway where a big gun-sword-battle has happened  Wade says nobody got hurt... and then a guy just falls from up above in the background from his wounds. Oops.It's a big comic spectacle that works better as a comedy  and somewhat as a love story  than as an action film. I say this despite a relatively coolly shot and choreographed opening sequence on a highway - which gets sort of cut back to in time during Wade's introduction in flashback - since when it gets back the fights and stunt work later on  the big climax included  it's just acceptable. The real skill of Miller and his team is in letting Ryan Reynolds take this character where it needs to  which is being a constant talking-s*** badass; by the time it comes down to Deadpool facing down the man who made him who he is  ""Ajax""  the tension isn't fully there just for the reason that Wilson has the ability to regenerate from his injuries (it's one of those they-worked-on-him sort of things).But what's further surprising is that the romantic side of the story works more than I expected thanks to a wonderful set up between Reynolds and Monica Baccarin as Vanessa. They trade barbs in such a way that you wonder if they'll run out of steam; some of their lines are crude  a lot of them very nasty and sex-related  and yet that made it endearing to me when things do get serious between them (the conflict of course that Wilson gets cancer  and all his troubles flow from there). If these actors didn't have good timing and chemistry it would falter  but they don't and so it doesn't  and by the time that the characters get reunited near the end the same spark is still there as are the real levels of sorrow about why they've been apart and what's kept it that way (some of it is Wilson's own doing  the sort of 'look a way I'm a hideous beast' cliché  which I forget if it's even a cliché).Could it have been less low-brow? Maybe. But it's smart enough to be exactly the kind of self-reflexive comic book movie that goes after all of the bulls*** with these movies  from the budgets to Jackman and beyond  and makes its own identity. I found it a lot of fun.",positive

Ajax was head of an underground ""let's change hopeless human bums in need of help into mutant superheroes"" project that had this suit with a faux sense of offering support to the downtrodden luring unfortunates into a warehouse that features a staff who seem content to pump them full of mutant goo and torture the change into effect! Ajax's suit convinces Cancer-stricken Wade (Reynolds) to give the mutant underground project a chance  and it leaves himwell  worse for wear. An oxygen deprivation tank encourages the mutant change on Wade which uglies his entire body. Going the Elephant Man route provides Wade with a modicum of sympathy  but I guess his mouth could hinder that somewhat. Let's just say that this film unleashes some pent-up frustration that comes with trying to offer a product to a wide audience  within a PG-13 rating. What many might perceive to be a niche Marvel character audience  Deadpool seems to be the answer to a certain demographic's prayers. There's a freeing feeling you can see in this film  with all the swearing  sex-obsessed dialogue  decapitated heads  direct-to-camera-fourth-wall-breaking  80s music (Chicago and Wham! make appearances!)  playful jabs at the X-Men (metallic muscle Colossus & firebrand Negasonic Teenage Warhead lend some help to Deadpool by film's end)  Stan Lee's cameo in a strip club (!)  and going for a completely off-the-wall back-and-forward origin story. Reynolds' energy and sheer exuberance (he is having so much fun and seems to be totally turned loose from the chains that bound him in ""Green Lantern"") give the film a buzz it sustains all the way through. Thankfully  he's never a buzzkill. Ajax is your basic cold-blooded villain who looks like someone Jason Statham is trying to outrun/outlast in a Transporter movie  with Gina Carano as his intense and mighty lieutenant (she gives Colossus quite a run for his money!). This is all about Reynolds and his blunt-force-object honesty and sense of humor. The quips are exhaustive  there's no shortage of Marvel vehicular carnage and explosions  epic encounters between fighting heroes and villains are here and accounted for  and even the friends treat each other rather harshly (Wade and his bartender buddy  Weasel (TJ Miller) share an exchange which doesn't politely hold back how Deadpool's new looks are a detriment to him; and a blind  black lady living in the slums who provides him a place to stay shares the oddest of friendships with Wade). This film's big box office has proved that Marvel could make a R-rated superhero film and it be successful. Look for the next film to be even more graphic  explicit  and against type. Deadpool's resistance towards the X-Men philosophy and how he corresponds with Colossus and the teenage firestarter were my personal favorite parts. Reynolds found his winner. Almost pulls out all the stops including quite the inspired opening credits which gleefully ribs the stereotypes of the comic book movie.",positive

However he finds out he has cancer. A mysterious man contacts him and says he can be cured of his cancer...but won't say how. Wade agrees to whatever treatment. He is tied down and tortured and pumped full of drugs by evil Ajax (Ed Skrein). It turns him ugly and into a mutant able to withstand any pain and a body that completely regenerates itself. He escapes and sets out to find Ajax and kill him. He wears a costume and calls himself Deadpool.Despite the synopsis this movie is actually quite funny. There are constant jokes by Reynolds and he's frequently breaking down the fourth wall and addressing the audience. There's also TONS of gratuitous violence but it's impossible to take it seriously with Reynolds constantly making jokes. It also has cameos by two of the X-Men and Stan Lee! However the sequence when we see Deadpool being tortured and shot full of drugs is not fun and Ajax is such a despicable villain the fun sort of drains out at times. However the final all out battle at the end makes up for it. So I liked it but it sometimes got too brutal. Still it is recommended. Also Reynolds is excellent in his role.,positive

The last Marvel movies to be R rated were the Blade series. It was clear that they were R rated due to the content (vampires and killing). I thought ""Deadpool"" would be along the same lines; an R rating for excessive blood  maybe gore  or maybe one too many F bombs. Well  ""Deadpool"" milked their R rating for all it was worth: plenty of profanity  nudity  sex and even a masturbation scene. That wasn't what I was expecting.Deadpool to me  in the lore of the Marvel Universe  is in the periphery. He was always a character I knew existed but never took the time to delve into his comics. ""Deadpool"" the movie was going to be my first full introduction. If first impressions last the longest  this one is going to stink.Deadpool is funny  in a crude  sophomoric kinda way. Anyone who's seen Ryan Reynolds in anything knows that he can talk a mile a minute and can be quite the laugh. Well  imagine Ryan Reynolds with no limitations. A lot of the humor was missed because A.) Ryan Reynolds talks too fast  B.) he made references to things obscure to you (or me in this case) or C.) it just fell flat. I expected humor and got it in spades plus some stuff I didn't care for. I expected some nice effects and fight scenes and also got that. The fight and gun play scenes were astounding which left me wanting more of it and less of the other stuff.This was the comic book movie for adults-- (which is weird because so many kids were in the theater. I don't think parents know what R rating means anymore) and not all adults. I think the movie could have been better with less profanity  less nudity and fewer sexual references. When I say sexual references I'm not talking subtle innuendos  I'm talking in-your-face crass sexual humor. Tone that all down an it is a lot better movie.",positive

But this was actually a very entertaining movie with lots of action and humor. I think it's one of the rare comic book movies that has just as much  if not more  appeal to the mainstream than to the fanboy set. Ryan Reynolds is funny and charming and I immediately wanted to forgive him for his past cinematic sins. The movie plays to his strengths as the likable frat boy (Van Wilder) much better than his last attempt at launching a superhero franchise (Green Lantern). The rest of the cast is decent  although this is Reynolds' show all the way. He controls every scene and thankfully has a good chemistry with all of his co-stars. The action scenes are very nicely done  as well  although the movie's climax is a little flat. The only real negative is that the CGI Colossus is pretty terrible-looking. Thankfully his role in the movie and how he plays off Reynolds and others provides lots of laughs. Still  he looks like a big cartoon and that is a little distracting. Anyway  this is a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously and gives the audience some great popcorn entertainment. Definitely worth a look even if you don't typically like these kind of movies.,positive

Having now seen it finally  seeing as audience reaction seemed more divisive (especially here where the dislike is unnecessarily vitriolic) which did put me off watching it for a while  it was a good film if not a great one. It was very entertaining  and credit is due for trying to take more of a comedic edge to a genre that can be taken seriously (sometimes overly so) and for taking risks. At the same  'Deadpool' is also uneven. 'Deadpool' for me did have its issues. Tonally  it is not always balanced  with too much emphasis on the humour and not enough on the action. Contrary to what others thought  most of the humour was enjoyable but there were jokes and lines that didn't land very well due to taking it too far with the crudeness and childishness (some of the superhero cliché jokes felt very out of date and stale). Other minuses are the overlong length  some repetition  a pretty forgettable villain and a rushed and muddled final act. However  'Deadpool' is very well made visually. Slick  stylish and brooding with typically well crafted effects. The music is haunting and rousing and most of the direction is very assured and sharp  if at times not always in control of the tonal balances. The action is dynamically choreographed and exciting  and the romantic and emotional elements just about avoid the mawkish sentimentality trap and instead give 'Deadpool' its heart.Most of the humour is very funny  though its extremely black comedic nature has proven to be an acquired taste. As said  that it tried to incorporate humour into an often taken seriously genre was interesting and refreshing  even if there is a try too hard element at times with how it's balanced with everything else. The story is a pretty lightweight one structurally  but the hugely energetic pace and sense of fun elevated it. Ryan Reynolds brings charismatic charisma  vulnerability and great comic timing to the title role  one he was born to play and he successfully allows one to root for his character. All the cast do a more than serviceable job  Morena Baccarin coming over the most confidently. In summary  good film if not great. Rough around the edges but not without its charm  like the titular character hero himself. 7/10 Bethany Cox,positive

On the one hand  I generally enjoy modern-day superhero movies  which are very much all of a kind but have decent special effects and lots of action to see them through. They're easy viewing. On the other hand  I'm no fan of crude humour and bad language  and I knew what to expect with this one. I don't think much of Ryan Reynolds  either. I was pleased to find  then  that I enjoyed DEADPOOL quite a bit. It's not one of my favourite superhero films but as an origin story it does the job nicely and there are lots of memorable quirky moments and characters to enjoy. As a comedy  it's also a lot wittier than I was expected  and I enjoyed picking up all of the pop culture references. The crudeness did nothing for me but most of it was in the form of throaway lines so didn't matter too much. The strong supporting cast features an on-form Ed Skrein and a typically hulking Gina Carano  but Colossus was my favourite 'star' here. The CGI-augmented action scenes are well staged and the action has a nicely brutal edge. To me  this feels like a natural successor to the CRANK films  albeit better made.,positive

The ""doctor"" named Francis (Ed Skrein) instead does a horrible experiment on him and soon the deformed man takes the name Deadpool and goes out for revenge.I'm not a comic book person and I know very little about them outside of what I see in movies. With that said  it seems DEADPOOL got a pretty big group of people who gathered around to say that a R-rated comic book movie would never work and that the studio was committing suicide. Well  the box office numbers certainly proved them wrong as the film managed to take in a lot of money as well as please critics and fans. Personally speaking while most comic book movies are good  they are start to look and sound alike so getting something as fresh as DEADPOOL was terrific.I think the best thing that can be said about the film is that it just stands out among the various other comic movies out there. Naturally the R-rating is the selling point because this ""hero"" loves to cuss  have sex  tell dirty jokes and when he kills someone he wants their brains splattered everywhere. All of this madness is what makes the film seem so fresh because the action scenes are pure 100% action with non-stop bloody violence that is just fun to watch. The comic tone is hilarious at times due to the character's sarcastic nature and dirty mouth. Everything here works extremely well and this includes the real mutants and their super powers. Everything in the film is a joke and what's most shocking is that it's all funny.The casting was certainly the most important thing and Reynolds handles the role with ease. I think it's safe to say after watching the film that they selected the perfect man for the part and can you really think of anyone who would have done it better? Reynold's comic timing is flawless and he really makes Deadpool one of the most memorable characters out there. Skrein is very good in the role as the villain and Morena Baccarin is also very good playing the love interest. Even more great humor comes from T.J. Miller in his role as the comic relief.DEADPOOL certainly earns its R-rating and delivers the goods in terms of dirty laughs and graphic violence. I'm not sure how many other comic book movies are going to be willing to do this but this certainly stands out from the crowd and best of all is that the dirty humor isn't just a gimmick because it actually works very well.",positive

This is a non-stop  fast-paced  4th wall breaking  no holds barred style of comedy. I guess a minority could object to its crudeness. There is a monotone to this style. That's why the funniest moment is the cabby's second ride. It comes out of nowhere. The shock and awe of it is hilarious. I like Negasonic and Colossus. Gina Carano again proves that she's no actor.

Like the film itself  it was all done with such irreverence and lack of respect for the genre  that I found it quite refreshing – particularly as superhero films continue to puff themselves into bigger and more serious epic franchises. Mostly  the film itself manages to deliver in the same vein  but it is not as consistent as I would have wanted – and I can understand those that hate it.For all its subversive humor  the plot of the film is a collection of familiar tropes – the kidnap  the revenge  the origin story etc. An added downside is that this flaw doesn't really matter  because the plot always feels like it is an afterthought that the writers added once they had all the jokes and scenes they wanted down on paper. These are pretty funny  and the irreverent tone helps it work  but if you are not in the right frame of mind then it will probably grate quite a lot. The action set-pieces are pretty enjoyable though  and it does play well as a faux-subversive entry in the genre.It is fun  rude  and gory; and it is enjoyable for it. It does have its weaknesses though  and in the end it is not as clever or different as it thinks it is.,negative

The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult  more adult than ""Kick-Ass "" but is much funnier.

And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it  is not everybody's taste of course  but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles)  than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this  leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played  not as successful  if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer  there are so many jokes in here  you will find many things to like.

I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did  but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb  and many of them glowing tributes  I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there  as well as DC  but with this venture  the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters  I'm not a prude  but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison  I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton""  and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside  this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted  I've never read a Deadpool comic  so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page  but if it is  it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes  well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete  I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots  but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out  otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer  there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second  I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally  there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie  to me it resembled a dead pool.",positive

Basically in New York City  former special forces operative Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) works as a mercenary  he meets and becomes romantically attached to escort Vanessa Carlysle (Gotham's Morena Baccarin). A year later Wade proposes to Vanessa and she accepts  but he suddenly collapses  at hospital he is diagnosed with terminal cancer  Vanessa remains by his side  but he fears losing her. Wade is approached by a Recruiter (Jed Rees) from a secret program  he offers him an experimental cure for his cancer  Wade initially refuses  but he later leaves Vanessa and undergoes the procedure. At a laboratory Wade meets and instantly resents Ajax (Ed Skrein) and Angel Dust (Gina Carano)  Wade is injected with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes  then he is subjected to weeks of torture to trigger mutation  with no success. Ajax  who Wade finds out his real name is Francis Freeman  reveals the true purpose of the experiments is to create super-powered slaves for wealthy customers  Wade does develop healing abilities  but his face and skin are severely disfigured  he escapes his chamber  but is impaled by Ajax and left inside the laboratory that is burning down. Wade survives and returns to the city  he wants to reconnect with Vanessa  but he is unable to come to terms with his appearance and stays away  with some help from his best friend Weasel (T.J. Miller) he decides to hunt down Ajax  who claimed he could cure his disfigurement. Wade becomes a masked vigilante  using the nickname ""Deadpool""  and he moves in with elderly blind woman Al (Leslie Uggams)  Deadpool follows a number of leads from various syndicates to find Ajax  he eventually locates her  causing chaos on the expressway. Cornering Ajax  Wade demands a cure for his disfigurement  but he is interrupted by two X-Men  Piotr Rasputin aka Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Ellie Phimister aka Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand)  they have been trying to recruit Deadpool  Ajax escapes  Deadpool is handcuffed to Colossus  but he cuts his own arm off to escape  his arm regenerates overnight. Now knowing that Wade is alive  Ajax goes to Weasel's bar and finds out about Vanessa  Weasel tells Wade that she is in danger  but he is still unable to face her  and she is already kidnapped  Wade is told by Ajax and Angel Dust to meet with them on a decommissioned helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to join him to confront Ajax and Angel Dust  Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel Dust  while Deadpool battle many henchmen  and eventually engages Ajax in close combat. After the big battle  the equipment holding the helicarrier upright is accidentally destroyed  Colossus  who was knocked out  wakes and takes Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety  Deadpool successfully saves Vanessa  and Ajax is subdued  he reveals there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement. Colossus urges Deadpool to be a true hero and spare Ajax  but Deadpool kills Ajax  he turns to Vanessa and removes his mask to reveal his disfigured face  she is angered that he left her  but she still loves and accepts him  they reconcile and kiss. Also starring Karan Soni as Dopinder  Michael Benyaer as Warlord and Stan Lee as Strip Club DJ. Reynolds is a good choice as the wisecracking anti- hero who calls himself a bad guy going against the ""worse guys""  his breaking of the fourth wall  sending up the clichés and in-jokes about him knowing he is in a superhero movie works well  he even jokes about his unfortunate performance as the Green Lantern. This X-Men spin- off is good fun  it makes you laugh in the right places  the romantic element is alright  you really root for the vulnerable and naughty masked mutant  the explosive chase and fight sequences  and some comical violence  combined with the special effects are great  overall it is a most worthwhile fantasy action comedy.

After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see  through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman  AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes  some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.,positive

Wow  ""Deadpool"" is a fantastic combination of action  comedy  satire and spoofs. The story in the movie is fairly straight forward  actually bordering on being generic. But it was the sly remarks  the physical comedy of the Wade/Deadpool character that really made the movie work out so nicely. And Ryan Reynolds  despite already having played other superhero roles  really was nicely cast for the Deadpool character.The audience is thrown into the fray right from the very beginning  and the movie kicks up into an impressive gear and high speed from the very start  and it never slows down.The cast in ""Deadpool"" were doing some good jobs with their given roles and characters. And I must admit that I was more than genuinely impressed with what Ryan Reynolds (playing Wade / Deadpool) managed to deliver with his part in this movie. But also Morena Baccarin (playing Vanessa) really brought something good to the movie with her skills and on-screen charisma. And T.J. Miller really had a great part in the movie  despite it not being a prominent character.There is a lot of action throughout the course of ""Deadpool""  which was really well choreographed and equally well executed.I will say that ""Deadpool"" is without a doubt the best superhero movie that I have ever seen.

But no hero.,2016-05-05,Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) falls in love with escort girl Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin)  but soon-after discovers that he has late-stage cancer. When a strange man approaches Wade saying that he can not only cure his disease  but also give him incredible powers  he is sceptical  but eventually undergoes the treatment—a long and agonising process that scars his entire body—unaware that the people conducting the operation intend to use him as a 'weapon for hire'.From the ironic opening credits to the inevitable post-credits sequence  Deadpool is an absolute blast  a side-splittingly funny  hyper-kinetic and incredibly bloodthirsty superhero movie for those fed up with normal superhero movies. This one takes everything expected from the genre and subverts it  creating a deliciously dark adventure in which the lead character  imbued with invincibility  doesn't want to be a hero he simply wants revenge. As Deadpool sets about finding Francis  the man who caused him so much pain and melted his good looks  he takes special delight in countless outrageous acts of extreme violence  pausing to break the fourth wall with witty remarks aimed at the viewer. This 'self-awareness' only adds to the fun.While not 'the best superhero movie ever' as some people claim (that honour still goes to Days of Future Past)  it's a very close second.

I am not familiar with the source comic book. The movie is rated R for a good reason  the main character has a very filthy potty mouth  but it fits his character. Plus a few shots of bare-chested women.This is an origin story. Ryan Reynolds is Wade  always a bit of a loose canon. At his favorite bar is a list on a chalkboard  a ""dead pool""  predicting who will be the next to get killed. Wade is with his girlfriend when he collapses  at the clinic his doctor informs him he has cancer  but in three places he doesn't need - his brain  his lungs  and his prostate.He meets a man who says he can ""fix"" him  Wade has no choice and submits. He ends up being tortured in various ways  it is an attempt to make the hidden beast in him come out. When he finally escapes he is disfigured but has gained some pretty impressive strength and fighting skills  plus his cancer is gone. He can't go openly as Wade anymore  so takes the name 'Deadpool.'His nemesis is Ed Skrein as Ajax  and his girlfriend is Morena Baccarin as Vanessa. Can he defeat Ajax and get his girl back?The action is impressive  including the opening ultra slo-mo shot of Deadpool and others in a roll-over car accident on a bridge.

It wasn't the wisest comparison (maybe filthy f***ing Bugs Bunny is far more accurate  but I digress)  in large part since the Muppets are family entertainment with an edge that can appeal to adults and yet still be good fun for kids  while Deadpool is hard-R action carnage with sometimes (ok  a good lot of the time) lines that will make many  many  many teenagers laugh (and some folks who get a few key references to things outside of this decade). I think I was just responding to the total irreverence of the whole thing  not to mention the constant breaking of the fourth wall - it's not something completely groundbreaking on its own (Spider-Man talks to the audience  for example)  but here it's aware of many of the faults that have come up on comic book and super-hero movies  including its own franchise. For me one of the most cathartic moments of this or any recent movie is seeing a short but noticeable image of an action figure of Deadpool from the 2009 Wolverine movie. Which sucked.Why it did is for reasons outside of the 'not getting the character' right thing (though that's part of it)  but suffice it to say what director Tim Miller (first timer! impressive that) and the writers (previously of the also super-self-conscious/meta Zombieland)  needed to do was to take the p*** out of the genre while also delivering a story that had some heart to it... wait  heart  in a movie that has the ""Merc with the Mouth"" Wade Wilson   the guy who goes through Weapon-X-program-stuff and comes out with the skin of insert-TJ-Miller-Joke-Here appearance? Sure  why not? If I can take it back to the Muppets one last time those movies had heart to them underneath as well. With this Deadpool movie  there's only a couple of scenes where there's no sarcastic lines or quips or just outright 'I'll talk s*** till the cows come home' stuff  but they do help to give the movie some grounding and keep things moving along well.When I say it's hard-R  I mean it - if you take your kids  make sure they know what they're in for and that despite the appearance of the Xavier School  this is very violent and bloody and with limbs flying and heads rolling and little tiny hands regenerating and... too much said. But for me  at least in the first half of the movie before it got to the climax (which I'll get to in a moment)  it was refreshing to see how violent it got. I'm not completely sure if it was Miller and the filmmaers' intentions but I suspected all of bodies laid to waste in sometimes horrifying ways is some kind of comment on how bloodless many of the comic book movies and other X-Men films can get. Sure people die and get stabbed by Wolverine and so on  but there's no consequences. Deadpool is the kind of movie where Colossus (that one big Russian metal guy who was in the other X-Men movie that I don't remember the name of) tries to tell Wade not to hurt any people on a highway where a big gun-sword-battle has happened  Wade says nobody got hurt... and then a guy just falls from up above in the background from his wounds. Oops.It's a big comic spectacle that works better as a comedy  and somewhat as a love story  than as an action film. I say this despite a relatively coolly shot and choreographed opening sequence on a highway - which gets sort of cut back to in time during Wade's introduction in flashback - since when it gets back the fights and stunt work later on  the big climax included  it's just acceptable. The real skill of Miller and his team is in letting Ryan Reynolds take this character where it needs to  which is being a constant talking-s*** badass; by the time it comes down to Deadpool facing down the man who made him who he is  ""Ajax""  the tension isn't fully there just for the reason that Wilson has the ability to regenerate from his injuries (it's one of those they-worked-on-him sort of things).But what's further surprising is that the romantic side of the story works more than I expected thanks to a wonderful set up between Reynolds and Monica Baccarin as Vanessa. They trade barbs in such a way that you wonder if they'll run out of steam; some of their lines are crude  a lot of them very nasty and sex-related  and yet that made it endearing to me when things do get serious between them (the conflict of course that Wilson gets cancer  and all his troubles flow from there). If these actors didn't have good timing and chemistry it would falter  but they don't and so it doesn't  and by the time that the characters get reunited near the end the same spark is still there as are the real levels of sorrow about why they've been apart and what's kept it that way (some of it is Wilson's own doing  the sort of 'look a way I'm a hideous beast' cliché  which I forget if it's even a cliché).Could it have been less low-brow? Maybe. But it's smart enough to be exactly the kind of self-reflexive comic book movie that goes after all of the bulls*** with these movies  from the budgets to Jackman and beyond  and makes its own identity. I found it a lot of fun.",positive

While this could very well be an ideal villain if tweaked  Deadpool seems to be a perfect alternative to the kiddie-family friendly Marvel summer fare so popular every year. He's feisty  insulting  cocky  abrasive  relentlessly chatty  honest-to-no-fault  keen to jump into danger at any moment (particularly with ""mutant powers"")  opportunistic (if he can get his revenge  no one will stand in his way)  and unafraid of any consequences of any of his actions. He was ""in the war"" (special forces) so his killing/fighting talents have reason. He's not an ""altogether bad guy"" as he is willing to risk it all to save his ""potential baby's mama""  but not before cracking wise and pulverizing heavies that follow behind this mutant that is impervious to pain (he can't feel ""anything"") named Ajax (Ed Skrein). Ajax was head of an underground ""let's change hopeless human bums in need of help into mutant superheroes"" project that had this suit with a faux sense of offering support to the downtrodden luring unfortunates into a warehouse that features a staff who seem content to pump them full of mutant goo and torture the change into effect! Ajax's suit convinces Cancer-stricken Wade (Reynolds) to give the mutant underground project a chance  and it leaves himwell  worse for wear. An oxygen deprivation tank encourages the mutant change on Wade which uglies his entire body. Going the Elephant Man route provides Wade with a modicum of sympathy  but I guess his mouth could hinder that somewhat. Let's just say that this film unleashes some pent-up frustration that comes with trying to offer a product to a wide audience  within a PG-13 rating. What many might perceive to be a niche Marvel character audience  Deadpool seems to be the answer to a certain demographic's prayers. There's a freeing feeling you can see in this film  with all the swearing  sex-obsessed dialogue  decapitated heads  direct-to-camera-fourth-wall-breaking  80s music (Chicago and Wham! make appearances!)  playful jabs at the X-Men (metallic muscle Colossus & firebrand Negasonic Teenage Warhead lend some help to Deadpool by film's end)  Stan Lee's cameo in a strip club (!)  and going for a completely off-the-wall back-and-forward origin story. Reynolds' energy and sheer exuberance (he is having so much fun and seems to be totally turned loose from the chains that bound him in ""Green Lantern"") give the film a buzz it sustains all the way through. Thankfully  he's never a buzzkill. Ajax is your basic cold-blooded villain who looks like someone Jason Statham is trying to outrun/outlast in a Transporter movie  with Gina Carano as his intense and mighty lieutenant (she gives Colossus quite a run for his money!). This is all about Reynolds and his blunt-force-object honesty and sense of humor. The quips are exhaustive  there's no shortage of Marvel vehicular carnage and explosions  epic encounters between fighting heroes and villains are here and accounted for  and even the friends treat each other rather harshly (Wade and his bartender buddy  Weasel (TJ Miller) share an exchange which doesn't politely hold back how Deadpool's new looks are a detriment to him; and a blind  black lady living in the slums who provides him a place to stay shares the oddest of friendships with Wade). This film's big box office has proved that Marvel could make a R-rated superhero film and it be successful. Look for the next film to be even more graphic  explicit  and against type. Deadpool's resistance towards the X-Men philosophy and how he corresponds with Colossus and the teenage firestarter were my personal favorite parts. Reynolds found his winner. Almost pulls out all the stops including quite the inspired opening credits which gleefully ribs the stereotypes of the comic book movie.",positive

However he finds out he has cancer. A mysterious man contacts him and says he can be cured of his cancer...but won't say how. Wade agrees to whatever treatment. He is tied down and tortured and pumped full of drugs by evil Ajax (Ed Skrein). It turns him ugly and into a mutant able to withstand any pain and a body that completely regenerates itself. He escapes and sets out to find Ajax and kill him. He wears a costume and calls himself Deadpool.Despite the synopsis this movie is actually quite funny. There are constant jokes by Reynolds and he's frequently breaking down the fourth wall and addressing the audience. There's also TONS of gratuitous violence but it's impossible to take it seriously with Reynolds constantly making jokes. It also has cameos by two of the X-Men and Stan Lee! However the sequence when we see Deadpool being tortured and shot full of drugs is not fun and Ajax is such a despicable villain the fun sort of drains out at times. However the final all out battle at the end makes up for it. So I liked it but it sometimes got too brutal. Still it is recommended. Also Reynolds is excellent in his role.,positive

The last Marvel movies to be R rated were the Blade series. It was clear that they were R rated due to the content (vampires and killing). I thought ""Deadpool"" would be along the same lines; an R rating for excessive blood  maybe gore  or maybe one too many F bombs. Well  ""Deadpool"" milked their R rating for all it was worth: plenty of profanity  nudity  sex and even a masturbation scene. That wasn't what I was expecting.Deadpool to me  in the lore of the Marvel Universe  is in the periphery. He was always a character I knew existed but never took the time to delve into his comics. ""Deadpool"" the movie was going to be my first full introduction. If first impressions last the longest  this one is going to stink.Deadpool is funny  in a crude  sophomoric kinda way. Anyone who's seen Ryan Reynolds in anything knows that he can talk a mile a minute and can be quite the laugh. Well  imagine Ryan Reynolds with no limitations. A lot of the humor was missed because A.) Ryan Reynolds talks too fast  B.) he made references to things obscure to you (or me in this case) or C.) it just fell flat. I expected humor and got it in spades plus some stuff I didn't care for. I expected some nice effects and fight scenes and also got that. The fight and gun play scenes were astounding which left me wanting more of it and less of the other stuff.This was the comic book movie for adults-- (which is weird because so many kids were in the theater. I don't think parents know what R rating means anymore) and not all adults. I think the movie could have been better with less profanity  less nudity and fewer sexual references. When I say sexual references I'm not talking subtle innuendos  I'm talking in-your-face crass sexual humor. Tone that all down an it is a lot better movie.",positive

But this was actually a very entertaining movie with lots of action and humor. I think it's one of the rare comic book movies that has just as much  if not more  appeal to the mainstream than to the fanboy set. Ryan Reynolds is funny and charming and I immediately wanted to forgive him for his past cinematic sins. The movie plays to his strengths as the likable frat boy (Van Wilder) much better than his last attempt at launching a superhero franchise (Green Lantern). The rest of the cast is decent  although this is Reynolds' show all the way. He controls every scene and thankfully has a good chemistry with all of his co-stars. The action scenes are very nicely done  as well  although the movie's climax is a little flat. The only real negative is that the CGI Colossus is pretty terrible-looking. Thankfully his role in the movie and how he plays off Reynolds and others provides lots of laughs. Still  he looks like a big cartoon and that is a little distracting. Anyway  this is a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously and gives the audience some great popcorn entertainment. Definitely worth a look even if you don't typically like these kind of movies.,positive
